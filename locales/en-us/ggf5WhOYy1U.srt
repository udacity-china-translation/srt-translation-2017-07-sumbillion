1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,250
So here we are in a terminal.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,540
Inside the terminal window,
we see a little message here,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,419
and another message
here, and a cursor.

4
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:13,390
Now, this message
is the Shell prompt.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,730
It usually displays some
information about the computer

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,289
you're logged into.

7
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:18,910
Exactly what
message you see here

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,559
will depend on your system.

9
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,479
Later on, we'll see
how to change it.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,719
If you type something in at the
Shell prompt and press Enter,

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,189
the Shell will try
to run whatever

12
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,770
you typed as a command.

13
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,519
Throughout this course,
you'll be learning

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,259
a bunch of Shell commands.

15
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:36,129
Here's the first one.

16
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,280
The echo command is how we get
the Shell to print messages

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,600
back to us.

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,890
It's like console.log in
JavaScript or Print in Python.

19
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,340
Try it out.

20
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,220
OK, what happens if I
want the greeting to be

21
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,350
a little bit more enthusiastic?

22
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,929
Hello, shello followed
by two exclamation marks.

23
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,630
Huh, that's weird.

24
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,920
Hello, shello echo.

25
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,216
Hello, shello.

26
00:00:58,216 --> 00:00:59,512
Hello, shello echo.

27
00:00:59,512 --> 00:01:00,280
Hello, shello.

28
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,350
Hey, if I said that a
bunch of times in a row

29
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,950
that could be a number one jam.

30
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,120
Hello, shello echo.

31
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,980
Hello, shello.

32
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,189
Hello, shello echo.

33
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:10,509
Hello, shello.

34
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,700
The point being, there
are some characters

35
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,100
that have a special
meaning to the Shell.

36
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:17,353
The exclamation
mark is one of them.

37
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:19,269
If you're ever typing
something into the Shell

38
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:23,310
and it seems to be treating what
you're saying in a weird way,

39
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,620
all you usually need to do is
to put single quotes around it.

40
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,540
Huh, there we go.

41
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,300
That's a little bit
less repetitive.
