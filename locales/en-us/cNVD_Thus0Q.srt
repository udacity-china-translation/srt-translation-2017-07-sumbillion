1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,230
What problems does material
design try to solve?

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,110
>> Well, the question of how
a user goes between all these

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,080
different devices is a key one.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,770
And to the user, it's really just
they're doing this one task.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,390
They're trying to do this one thing and
it doesn't matter so

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,900
much to them whether it happens to
be on the phone in their pocket, or

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,790
the laptop that's on their desk.

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,090
So we want that kind of continuity.

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,050
Something else we really
focus on is motion.

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,530
We've seen all too often that motion
is something that just kind of gets

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,990
tacked on at the end.

12
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,220
So you do all this other work, and then
you just kind of add in some animations.

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,260
>> After effect or something like that.

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,930
>> It is literally that, right?

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,670
It's all done, so
throw that thing in there.

16
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,020
We try to think about motion from
the very start, because we think that

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,080
kind of knowing how things
are going to move around is so

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,770
powerful for giving feedback to
the user about what they're doing.

19
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,200
So, you want to kind of plan for
that in advance.

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,475
And we try to have these materials that
give the material design it's name.

21
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,280
Or things like kind of paper and

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,099
ink that can kind of move in
predictable ways that feel tactile and

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,360
feel familiar to the user, but aren't
bound by kind of boring old reality.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,850
It can do kind of these really
interesting things that makes

25
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,130
the user feel powerful,

26
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:20,400
and that's a key goal towards giving
them a satisfying experience.

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,510
>> So the inspiration comes
from design and material,

28
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,820
actual material getting to play with.

29
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,590
>> Yeah,
I mean we really wanted to look at

30
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,680
things that felt familiar to the user.

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,330
And we engage with those
materials every day.

32
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,010
We don't engage with, kind of,
these pieces of inscrutable glass.

33
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,560
>> That's right.

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,080
>> In our day to day lives except
when we're using these devices.

35
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,280
So why should that be the metaphor?

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,930
Let's go for something that's
a little bit more predictable.

37
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,640
>> So where do I as an entrepreneur come
to learn more about the material design?

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,490
>> The best place to start
is just Google.com/design.

39
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,540
So from that site,
we have a full specification,

40
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,160
a set of guidelines that
describes material design.

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,530
It breaks down the philosophy behind it,
gives you some key principles to employ.

42
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,140
It's richly illustrated with imagery,
with motion,

43
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,620
samples of video, and also has a lot
of resources that you can download.

44
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,900
So fonts, color palettes, sticker
sheets of kind of common components for

45
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,690
all of the typical design
tools that you might use.

46
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,920
>> So I can use those out of the box,
and not reinvent the wheel, right?

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,650
>> Exactly, and then it should be
very close to what you're getting on

48
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,630
the platforms that
directly support material.
