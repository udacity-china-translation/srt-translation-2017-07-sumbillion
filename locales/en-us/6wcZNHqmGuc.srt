1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,565
We've reached roughly the halfway point of this lesson,

2
00:00:02,565 --> 00:00:04,469
and we want to check back in on your progress.

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,864
So far, you covered new ways to declare variables using let and const,

4
00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:11,690
how to write template literals for easier string interpolation,

5
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:13,394
destructuring arrays and objects,

6
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:16,460
and some shorthand ways for initializing objects.

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,320
At this point, we hope you're starting to see how these improvements to

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,740
the JavaScript language will impact the way you write code moving forward.

9
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,963
The remainder of this lesson will focus on the addition of the for... of loop,

10
00:00:26,963 --> 00:00:29,519
the rest parameter, and the spread operator.

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,969
However, before you move on,

12
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:33,973
there's one more thing we want to mention - iteration.

13
00:00:33,973 --> 00:00:37,889
Iteration is a new mechanism for looping through data in ES6.

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,079
Understanding what iteration is and how it

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,000
works will be important for completing the rest of this lesson.
