1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,750
So now that we have multiple solutions,
I guess it's time to come up to

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,400
a decision, and
to come up with one solution, right?

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,160
>> That's right.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,280
So, the decide stage is important

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,930
in helping filter down
the ideas that were collected.

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,640
The previous stage,
which is about diverging,

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,850
has made it so that everyone has created
a lot of sketches, and they're starting

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,820
to develop some passion and
attachment to the things that they have.

9
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:31,260
During the deside stage, we ask the team
to put their ideas on the board so

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,390
everyone can see them.

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,070
At that point,
we ask people to remain silent.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,970
We call this process Zen Voting.

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,380
Just like in a zen spirit,
you want to be quiet and

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,680
consider things in a reflective manner.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,590
During this process, we ask people
to review what the sketches

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,490
are before anyone gets to bias
them with their opinions.

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,760
So, as they review the sketches
that other people have created,

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,060
they start thinking, what do they
like about the other solution?

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,920
And you're always curious.

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,823
I made this.

21
00:01:01,823 --> 00:01:04,653
What did the others make?

22
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:06,390
It's fun to see that.

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,590
After everybody has voted, it is time
to actually discuss things in person.

24
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,610
So, something that's not natural to
teams happened that's really valuable.

25
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,520
People had individual,
personal time to be creative.

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,250
Then they have personal time to view
results, and they have time to consider

27
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,120
and cast their vote before anyone else
could say, I think this is important.

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,180
And so they are biased.

29
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,810
So now that they have gone through that,

30
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,710
they're ready to look at
things as a community.

31
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,750
As a community,
the team reviews what are the ideas,

32
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,570
what are the most popular ones and
then quickly they get to see

33
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,440
more clearly some things rise to the top
and maybe others are less important.

34
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,420
So there minds are changed based
on what the community has decided.

35
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,150
Research shows that this
community-based voting

36
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,940
can be more powerful than
the decisions of a single expert.

37
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,900
For example,
if you have a horse race and

38
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,919
exports betting on the horses, and
if you have a crowdsourcing solution,

39
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,510
and you're testing how a crowd
making predictions on who will win.

40
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,640
It is likely that the crowd
might often be the experts

41
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,820
over what you usually think, is that
the expert will be more powerful.

42
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,290
Crowdsourcing a decision makes
the team decide faster and

43
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,730
it helps the team often gather
the wisdom of everyone who is involved.

44
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,160
>> So what could go wrong in this stage?

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,630
>> What could go wrong in this stage?

46
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,010
Decisions are a crucial
aspect of what teams do.

47
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,410
In fact, the life of a team is made of
all of the decisions that they make.

48
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,950
So we cannot pretend this is
an easy process for teams.

49
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,170
Things can go wrong if one person
is trying to overpower and

50
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,550
put opinions over others.

51
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,810
This happens all the time.

52
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,290
This is why we have
a leader of a sprint.

53
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,850
The leader of the sprint is
watching the entire group.

54
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,650
They want to make sure that the
introverts and the extroverts are heard,

55
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,450
the designers and the engineers,
the CEO and the intern.

56
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,400
Everyone could have a great
decision at this point.

57
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,730
>> So at this stage we look at the
solutions, we vote, and we make a call.

58
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,230
>> That's right.
