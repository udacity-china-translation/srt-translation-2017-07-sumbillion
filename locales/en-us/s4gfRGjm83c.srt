1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,080
It seems like there might also be a ton
of other considerations if you're

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,240
thinking about hearing impairment,
visual impairment.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,964
When people are designing for all these
users can you compromise the design?

4
00:00:10,964 --> 00:00:14,193
Will the product maybe change too much?

5
00:00:14,193 --> 00:00:17,416
>> Yeah, it's a very good question and
there definitely does

6
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:21,320
seem like there's a lot at first
glance to really consider.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,835
And in actuality,

8
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:28,608
if you do leave all these considerations
to the end of the product cycle,

9
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:34,194
it can compromise the product because
there's a lot of rethinking and

10
00:00:34,194 --> 00:00:39,708
refactoring that needs to go in,
to just kind of fit these things in.

11
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:43,559
And so that's why we're always
asking people, and informing,

12
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,210
and educating people on how to
think of these things early on.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,370
I think when you just look at the
general steps within the design process,

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,195
all of the points that when you're
thinking about accessibility,

15
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:59,378
they're integrated in every step
that you're already thinking about.

16
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:00,758
So again, with color contrast,

17
00:01:00,758 --> 00:01:03,730
you're already thinking about what
is your color palette going to be.

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,707
So, then just on top of that you have
some additional standards to maybe try

19
00:01:08,707 --> 00:01:13,291
to follow and look at to ensure
that there's enough contrast there.

20
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,010
Hey, we're here at the OXO website.

21
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,721
I wanted to bring this up because I
feel like they have a really good

22
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:22,292
approach to universal design, and

23
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:26,333
they have this great quote on
here that I wanted to read.

24
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:30,172
When we talk about designing for
accessibility or universal design,

25
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:34,530
it's important to note that that does
not mean designing products fully usable

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,376
by everybody,

27
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:40,000
since there is no product that can
truly fulfill the needs of all users.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,890
But, when all users' needs are taken
into consideration in the initial

29
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,847
design process,

30
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:48,828
the result is a product that can be
used by the broadest spectrum of users.

31
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:51,904
So, I feel like that's a great
way to kind of sum up that, yes,

32
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:55,290
there is a lot to consider, but
it's not about making compromises.

33
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,651
In the end, when you do
consider these things up front,

34
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,421
you end up with a better
product overall.

35
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:01,279
>> Yeah, that's great.

36
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:04,370
And how can an entrepreneur
learn more about accessibility?

37
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,836
What resources are available to them?

38
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:09,900
>> The great thing is there's a lot
of resources out there online.

39
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,738
A few just to kind of rattle off,

40
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:16,283
are the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines, which you can find online.

41
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:20,321
That's a really thorough list of
standards that you would want to meet,

42
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:21,910
and need to meet.

43
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,480
And they have great examples on
there as well, and resources.

44
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,459
Different companies have provided
their own design guidelines.

45
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,270
Google is one of them,
which you can see here.

46
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,932
This is the Google Accessibility website
and specifically these are our design

47
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:41,087
guidelines that we came up with, which
are based on a lot of the standards

48
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:45,923
that were developed by the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines.

49
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:51,710
Apple has a great resource as well, for
their accessibility design guidelines.

50
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,234
And there's also some really
interesting tools out there.

51
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:55,440
There's plugins.

52
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,426
There's a plugin called SEE that allows
you to kind of simulate what your

53
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:04,923
page or site would look like with
different vision impairments,

54
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:07,650
as well as color blindness.

55
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,607
Yeah, so there's a lot that's out there.

56
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,107
>> Great.
