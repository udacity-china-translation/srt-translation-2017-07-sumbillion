1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,280
Here are a handful of methods that can
help you during the understand stage.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,720
I'll give you a quick overview
of each of these methods.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,810
The first is 360 degree lightning talks.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,885
As Nadia mentioned, 360 degree
lightning talks are incredibly useful.

5
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:21,256
The deliverable of the design sprint
should meet the business goals,

6
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:25,860
satisfy user needs and be possible
with current or emerging technology.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,920
Here are the questions that
should be addressed by anyone who

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,946
gives these talks.

9
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:33,551
For the business side, that person
should be able to address what's

10
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:36,797
profitable and sustainable for
the business in the long run?

11
00:00:36,797 --> 00:00:39,582
And what are the current business needs?

12
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:43,241
Anyone speaking to the user
experience should be able to answer,

13
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:44,447
what do people need?

14
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:47,883
And what's delightful or
useful to the user?

15
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:48,671
And finally,

16
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:52,620
someone should be able to speak
knowledgeably to technical concerns.

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,895
What's possible with today's technology?

18
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:58,563
Or what features can be built now or
over time?

19
00:00:58,563 --> 00:01:02,667
Lightning talks are meant to be a quick
way to address those major concerns.

20
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,245
Now of any of these
activities that you do,

21
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:07,763
you should be sure to
do user interviews.

22
00:01:07,763 --> 00:01:11,268
You want to talk to users at
the beginning of the design sprint and

23
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:14,787
at the end of the design sprint,
so you can validate your work.

24
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:18,979
User interviews allow you to understand
the goals and the motivations of users,

25
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,798
you might also try exploring some of
their emotions and how they feel about

26
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:26,827
existing products or about particular
features that you want to implement.

27
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:30,599
If you have existing designs, you can
definitely ask a user about them.

28
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,582
If not, you could always ask a user
about a competitor's design.

29
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:37,785
The interview should follow
a sort of arc like this.

30
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:39,871
You want to get to know
the interviewee at first,

31
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:43,500
so make them feel comfortable and
keep a conversational tone.

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,270
You also want to be genuinely
interested in the person, so

33
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,810
you can ask them starter
questions just to build rapport.

34
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,960
Then you can plan your
questions accordingly, so

35
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,630
you can get out their own stories and
the general moments in this diagram.

36
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,540
Be sure to thank the user and
wrap-up with any followup steps.

37
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,920
If you don't have any
current user research,

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,640
then you should definitely consider
going to visit actual users.

39
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,470
This would be a field visit.

40
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,430
A field visit or

41
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,720
field study will let you observe how
consumers use similar products or

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,400
you can take note of the context in
which users use that product or service.

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,948
You can also ask questions about
their behaviors, they're likes and

44
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:24,304
interests and
their pain points or problems.

45
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:27,902
You might do usability testing with
them, if you have current designs.

46
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:31,740
Or you might competitor designs,
if you don't have current ones.

47
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,560
Or finally, you might gather feedback on
early ideas, copy for your webpage or

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,190
app and
particular features that users may want.

49
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,220
This would just be concept testing.

50
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,840
A stakeholder map is another necessity
that can help you think about

51
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,440
all the players related to your
business or your industry.

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,350
For example, the stakeholder map for

53
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,390
the SuperDuper shopping
app would look like this.

54
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,493
Notice that this map includes internal
stakeholders, such as the user and

55
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:03,869
external stakeholders,
like the suppliers and specialists.

56
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:07,995
You could imagine building up particular
features from recommendations of

57
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:09,674
a nutritionist or allergist.

58
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:13,789
These specialists might play a role in
recommending foods to particular users

59
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:17,032
based on their dietary restrictions,
their dietary goals or

60
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:19,270
their cooking habits.

61
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:24,010
This last activity is another great way
to get perspective on the industry.

62
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,110
You can check out competitor's apps or
websites to get a sense for

63
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,130
what they're doing.

64
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,274
This can help you figure out what's
happening in your current space or

65
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:31,815
industry.

66
00:03:31,815 --> 00:03:36,354
And you can also analyze, how's your
approach different from these others?

67
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:39,838
Is it a subset of features or
is it marketing efforts?

68
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:44,128
You can also see particular UI
elements or design elements and flows,

69
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:47,628
that appeal to you and
others that you might want to avoid.

70
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,048
Whatever methods you choose,

71
00:03:49,048 --> 00:03:53,200
you should make sure that you summarize
your findings from the activities.

72
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,180
These findings should be on your mind
and on the minds of anyone on your team,

73
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,480
as you go into the next
stage of the design sprint.
