1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,670
So now that we have the dream solution,
and

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,300
we all decide it's best,
we move to prototyping, right?

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,490
>> That's right.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,870
Prototyping is a wonderful
way to test your ideas.

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,340
In fact, we want to make prototypes
that are real enough to feel, so

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,200
that we can test them with users,
and that's all that's required.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,650
Prototyping can take many forms.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,775
The simplest is to do a paper prototype
where you can quickly gather feedback.

9
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:31,367
One level up from that is to work on
digital designs that are mid fidelity or

10
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:32,417
high fidelity.

11
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:36,532
The higher the fidelity the easier it is
to test and to get feedback from users

12
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:40,533
because they're looking something
that's a little bit more polished.

13
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:44,980
A next level of prototyping is
actually creating physical prototypes.

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,424
When we work on something like Project
Glass at Google or Project Moon, it's

15
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:56,221
not about software always, it's about
what does the physical device look like?

16
00:00:56,221 --> 00:01:00,866
So that's when it's useful
to have materials that

17
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:05,196
help you create a quick
shape of a general idea.

18
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:07,958
Other prioritizes we
have made include video.

19
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,784
In fact, if you try to explain
the product to some one,

20
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:13,002
creating a video is super, super useful.

21
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:14,280
>> Yeah, Dropbox did that.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,905
>> That's right.

23
00:01:14,905 --> 00:01:15,464
>> Yeah.

24
00:01:15,464 --> 00:01:18,636
>> [LAUGH] The little how to videos
that a lot of companies use to

25
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:22,570
describe their services are really
useful in the design phase.

26
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,530
If you make it straight on, even if
it's shot with a little mobile phone,

27
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,970
and the users are the friends
that you're working with.

28
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,840
That can be sufficient to explain the
idea to a user, or to an investor, and

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,090
to test it.

30
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,960
If you want the high quality prototype,
you need to spend longer developing it.

31
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,400
>> So I can actually code it.

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,040
>> That's right.

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,140
I think coding a prototype is a great
idea, so some people are able

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,730
to really sprint, and within two days,
start to already call the prototype.

35
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,000
And then you can have
an interactive demo.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,760
Or some people take maybe four or
five days,

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,480
depending on how complex
the solution is.

38
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,990
So the duration of the prototyping

39
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,300
phase is usually what determines
the duration of the sprint.

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,310
This is the key aspect in which
actually the work is getting made.

41
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,350
If you're someone who loves to code,
who loves to design,

42
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,270
this is the phase that
you really get to shine.

43
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,920
And if you're looking for a low
fidelity prototype, a short sprint,

44
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,320
a few hours might be sufficient.

45
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,160
If you want something that's high
fidelity, or requires a demo or

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,280
a video, you're better advised to have
a whole week of the team's time so

47
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,760
you can make something beautiful.

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,670
>> How do I know which to choose, if I
choose a high fidelity or low fidelity?

49
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,253
What is the best?

50
00:02:34,253 --> 00:02:38,741
>> Okay, so, if you're working on a new
product, it's probably best to shoot for

51
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,804
medium fidelity.

52
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:44,580
That means that you're not looking
at paper prototypes necessarily.

53
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,350
You might have some early wire frames,

54
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,980
and that you're starting
to put some color on them.

55
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,640
Or that you also use Keynote or
a quick prototyping tool that

56
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,270
your engineers know how to use in
order to bring some life to the ideas.

57
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,410
We believe in teams choosing
their own prototyping tools.

58
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,000
There's a lot that's
available on the market, and

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,090
the right ones are the ones
your team loves to use.

60
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,114
If you're wondering where to start,
Sketch is a really great example.

61
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:15,505
So is Adobe Suite, although it does
take a little bit of time to learn.

62
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:16,537
And then Keynote and

63
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:19,700
Google Sites are also really
useful in prototyping quickly.
