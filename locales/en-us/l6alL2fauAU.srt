00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,864
Collecting data and
tracking metrics can be tricky.

2
00:00:02,864 --> 00:00:08,029
So, here are some tips and awesome
tools for how to go about that process.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,001
First is Google Analytics.

4
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:12,241
It's great for getting stats on traffic.

5
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:17,270
You can see demographics, user devices,
and browser types inversions.

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,518
It's a bit more exploratory in nature,
but

7
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:22,759
you can quickly get data on page
views and click through rates.

8
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:26,128
You do want to be careful because
oftentimes the data does not show

9
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:27,650
unique users.

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,170
Analytics can be messy, so it's good
to reproduce the numbers in two tools.

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,360
Mixpanel is another great tool
to measure user activities.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,549
It's particularly great for
measuring drop off in a funnel.

13
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:44,206
You can build customer funnels to
determine if students drop off at step

14
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:48,722
one step two, or step three of any
process or sequence of behaviors.

15
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,900
It's also useful for
measuring retention.

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,920
Now, you will need to be deliberate
about instrumenting events

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,230
that you want to track
when using the tool.

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,340
This forces you to get clear about what
you want to know about your users.

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,420
If you come across big differences when
using two tools like Google Analytics

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,630
and Mixpanel, you want to dig deep to
determine which value is more reliable

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,240
and what might be
driving this difference.

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,740
If you're building an app,

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,140
AdMob is another excellent
tool to add to your arsenal.

24
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,940
It offers many features,
such as flows to the application,

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,120
user exit points, and ways to
automatically maximize add revenue.

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,500
If you're looking to conduct surveys,
you might use tools such as Qualtrics.

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,140
They're a popular solution for MPS.

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,650
You might also try SurveyMonkey or
Google forms.

29
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,850
Once you have a user base and
feel like you have a core product,

30
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,770
you can optimize around smaller changes
in your website, such as layout,

31
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,270
headlines, button colors, and images.

32
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,270
This is called the A/B testing and

33
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,370
Optimizely is one tool that
lets you do this easily.

34
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,510
Now, A/B testing isn't the best
way to go, and certainly,

35
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,540
not when you're first starting out.

36
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,490
Up next, Pete from Optimizely will
discuss why this is in more detail.
