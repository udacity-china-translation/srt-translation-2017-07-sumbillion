1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,680
Basic traffic metrics, such as
unique visitors, overall pageviews,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,260
session length and interval,
and traffic sources,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,720
can help you establish a good baseline
on how a site or an app is doing.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,720
But you'll want other metrics
to help you monitor the quality

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,660
of the user experience.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,490
The HEART framework can
help you define UX metrics

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,540
that are relevant to your product.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,120
HEART is an acronym that stands for
five broad categories.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,860
First is happiness.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,930
These metrics are often captured through
surveys, and measure user attitudes for

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,680
things like satisfaction, perceived
ease of use, and net promoter score.

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,860
Engagement is the second category.

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,890
These metrics monitor user behavior,
perhaps frequency, intensity, and

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,060
depth over some period of time.

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,610
For example, Udacity might be interested
in the number of videos watched

16
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,740
per user, per day.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,170
Instagram, on the other hand,

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,680
might measure the number of photos
uploaded per user, per week.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,400
These types of metrics will
really depend on the types of

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,900
activities that your users will do.

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,310
The next category is Adoption.

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,550
You can track the number of new users
who use a product or potential feature.

23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,720
For instance, you might track the number
of new accounts created each week, or

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,250
daily usage of a feature such
as bookmarking in a browser.

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,770
The R is for Retention.

26
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,310
You learned about Retention all ready,

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,680
which lets you track active users from
some starting time to some ending time.

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,840
Finally, the last
category is task success.

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,140
These types of metrics are related
to traditional behavior metrics,

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,040
such as efficiency,
time to complete a task, effectiveness,

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,820
which is percent of completed tasks,
and error rate.

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,260
Now, you don't need to have metrics for
all of these categories.

33
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,020
Instead, you should think
about which categories and

34
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,330
their associated metrics would be most
important for the entire product.

35
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,370
You also might think about which
metrics would be important for

36
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,030
specific features of a product.
