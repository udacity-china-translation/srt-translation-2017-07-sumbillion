1
00:00:00,511 --> 00:00:01,010
OK.

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,200
So much for listing your files.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,269
How about moving them around?

4
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:07,399
Here, I've got this
documents directory

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,630
with a whole bunch of files
in it and kind of a big mess.

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,280
I'd like to make
some subdirectories

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,099
and get things organized.

8
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,419
Now, in the GUI,
I'd need to do a lot

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,760
of dragging and dropping and
making new folders and so on.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,170
But in the shell, I can do it
with just a couple of commands.

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,200
The first command I'll
use is MKDIR, which

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,899
stands for make directory.

13
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:33,780
I've downloaded a bunch
of books as epub files,

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,020
so I'll make a directory
called Documents

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,380
slash books to move them into.

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,740
Now I could cd into the
Documents directory first,

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,850
but I don't have to.

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,550
I can just make that
directory from here.

19
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:50,159
And you can see that when
I make it from the shell,

20
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,250
it shows up in the
graphical interface as well.

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,460
Next, I'll move the epub
files into that directory.

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,329
The command for moving things
is MV, which is short for move.

23
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,759
I have to tell it
two things, where

24
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,129
I want to move something from
and where I want to move it to.

25
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:11,039
Now, I could do these
all individually,

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,500
but we just saw that we
can use a star instead.

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,829
So I'll use MV for move
documents slash star

28
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,609
dot epub documents slash books.

29
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:27,459
What is that thing or what are
the things that I want to move,

30
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:29,549
and where do I want
to move them to?

31
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,420
And now if I LS documents
slash books, or open it up,

32
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,310
there they are.
