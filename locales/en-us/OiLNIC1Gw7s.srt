1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,690
So, you have the heart framework to
think about categories and metrics.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,600
Now, which metrics should you actually
track to make data informed decisions?

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,852
Well, that will depend on your product.

4
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:13,370
You want to create
a small set of metrics or

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,250
key performance indicators that
everyone on your team cares about.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,000
To do that,
here's a process that can help you.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,610
First, you should think about
the top-level goals for

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,380
the product or feature.

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,760
This is a good time to check in
with stakeholders, investors, and

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,300
anyone else on the team.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,940
The discussion allows you to
collect different ideas for

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,800
the goals and build consensus about
which goals are most important.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,850
Now, a common mistake is to define
the goals in terms of the metric.

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,040
For example, you might say that your
goal is to increase the number of people

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,340
who make a purchase, which is common for
many e-commerce websites.

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,380
Instead, you should think about
the user experience improvements

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,110
that could help drive that change.

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,040
So be sure to narrow in on
your definition of the goal.

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,360
Next, you want to pair low level
signals to each of the goals.

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,730
For example, at Udacity,
an engagement signal might be,

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,370
how many minutes of video a user
watches with each session.

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,040
You might also look at failure signals,
such as failed searches when a user

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,440
searches for something, but
doesn't click on any results.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,220
Once you have a couple signals down, you
should ask some additional questions to

25
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,690
determine which signals might be best.

26
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,920
First, you should ask how easy or
difficult is it to track this signal?

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,840
You might be able to come
up with a better proxy or

28
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,410
a different signal to
track that same thing.

29
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,800
It may be that the website or

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,500
app is not instrumented to log
relevant events and actions.

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,730
So, you might need to do some
additional research at this point.

32
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,350
Another question you should ask is,

33
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,760
is the signal sensitive to changes in
the design of the website or the app?

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,440
After you've thought
about your goals and

35
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,170
your signals, it's time to
craft your specific metrics.

36
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,320
The metrics you choose should
be prioritized based on the main

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,080
goals of the product
that you defined first.

38
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,880
You can always come back to refine
the metrics based on what you need do or

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,240
from what you learned.

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,340
You also want to be careful
about adding too many metrics.

41
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,120
Often times, your metrics will
be associative with one another.

42
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,310
And you want the ones that tell
you about user behavior and

43
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,580
about your product.

44
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,190
You want the metrics that
inform you of what to do next.

45
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,760
Download the template in the
downloadables and write your own goals,

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,335
signals, and metrics for some of
the categories in the HEART Framework.

47
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:23,815
You don't need to have a goal for
every category.

48
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:24,785
Just think about two or

49
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:28,335
three goals that you think are most
important to measure for your product.

50
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:31,235
