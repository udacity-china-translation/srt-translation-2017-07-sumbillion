00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Good job! You are now ready for lesson three.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,150
But before you move on, let's recap what you learned in this lesson.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,705
In this lesson,we covered a new way to write functions - the arrow function.

4
00:00:10,705 --> 00:00:12,032
We also looked at how you can use

5
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:15,865
default function parameters to pass default values to functions.

6
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:18,000
And finally, we wrapped it up with JavaScript classes.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,679
Simulated through functions.

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,969
Right, simulated through functions.

9
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:24,029
In the next lesson, you will explore the latest set of

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,000
built-ins that are now available to you in JavaScript.
