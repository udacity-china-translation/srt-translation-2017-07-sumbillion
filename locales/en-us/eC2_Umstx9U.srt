1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,649
You ready Richard?

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:03,270
Almost. Hang on.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,395
As you can see this wall is in bad shape.

4
00:00:06,395 --> 00:00:08,560
Richard is getting something to fill it in.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,110
Still looking for it.

6
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:12,138
There's a little bit of this wall that's missing

7
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:14,474
and once Richard finds what he's looking for,

8
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:16,259
we're going to fill the hole so you won't be able to

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,440
tell anything is wrong with it or missing.

10
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,818
Found it.

11
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:21,589
In the United States,

12
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,129
we call this Spackling,

13
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:25,375
and it's just a common paste to fill holes

14
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,875
in cracks to smooth out any defects in the wall.

15
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,155
In the United Kingdom,

16
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:32,143
a popular brand name for this is Polyfilla.

17
00:00:32,143 --> 00:00:37,140
Using Spackling or Polyfilla it's impossible to tell that there's a hole in this wall.

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,929
For the web, a polyfill does the same thing.

19
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,420
There's some bit of functionality that might be

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,910
missing in a browser that needs to get filled.

21
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,119
A polyfill is a JavaScript file that patches a hole

22
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,000
by replicating some native feature for browsers that don't have it yet.
