00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,800
Hi.

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,750
I'm with Jen who's a lead designer
with Google Apps Accessibility.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,780
And Jen has over 15 years
of design experience.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,480
And today, Jen,
I'm really curious to get your insight.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,570
Our students have learned about user
interaction and information design.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,130
What else is important when it
comes to designing a good product?

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,190
I think one of the key things that
a lot of people overlook initially, but

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,245
is extremely important is accessibility.

9
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:26,020
>> Mm-hm.

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,610
And what's accessibility?

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,560
>> Accessibility is about trying to
make products that are accessible and

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,530
usable by all people regardless
if they have a disability or

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,450
not It's closely related to universal
design, which is all about the process

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,320
of making products usable by people
with all ranges of abilities,

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,650
as well as they can use them
in all ranges of situations.

16
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,490
So just thinking about if you
can envision a user using

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,690
your product with one hand, maybe it
wasn't designed intentionally for

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,370
that, but can they use it with one hand?

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,280
And this would benefit users that might
have certain motor impairments, but

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,480
it would also benefit users that maybe
have a hand busy holding a baby or

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,860
a large bag of groceries.

22
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,116
That's kind of the idea
behind accessibility design.

23
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:17,690
>> Okay, and you mention some of
the impairments that someone might have.

24
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,840
What other sorts of impairments
might people bring to a product that

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,824
might prevent them from successfully
using a product in the first place?

26
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:28,490
>> There's a number of common
impairments that we consider, and

27
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,270
they range from having visual
impairments, being color blind,

28
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,720
having hearing impairments, cognitive
impairments, and motor impairments.

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,860
And the thing to note
with all of these is that

30
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,360
there's a wide range of severity
within each of these impairments, so

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,180
you could have just slight vision
loss to being totally blind.

32
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,130
And the other thing is
that a lot of people

33
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,320
tend to have multiple
impairments at one time.

34
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,522
It definitely makes things
interesting to design for, but

35
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:03,890
it's certainly a reality
that we need to consider.

36
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,162
And one of the things that I always love
to talk to people about and remind them,

37
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:12,308
when you start to think about designing
for people with disabilities a lot of

38
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:16,950
people tend to kind of treat them as
like they're in a separate group.

39
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,665
And it's a group of people that you
could consider or could not consider.

40
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:23,490
>> Mm.
>> But in reality, we're all going to

41
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,220
have some sort of impairment most
likely and within our lifetime.

42
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,790
One of the important things that I feel
that people need to keep in mind is that

43
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,910
when you're thinking about people with
disabilities a lot of designers and

44
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,100
different people tend to think of them
as a totally separate group that may or

45
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,870
may not, or can or
can not be considered in the process.

46
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,170
But in actuality,

47
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,060
all of us are going to have a disability
at some point in our lives.

48
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,920
And these things can be temporary,
like a broken arm.

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,160
They can be situational,

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,930
like if you're riding a bike and
maybe can't see your small phone screen.

51
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,670
And they can be just natural
progression of aging.

52
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,420
So it's really important
to consider these things.

53
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,260
because if you're not,
in a sense you're not considering

54
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,560
how to design these products for
yourself at some point.

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,550
>> Yeah.

56
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,330
So, what other considerations, I guess,
or why would it be important for

57
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,520
entrepreneurs to think
about accessibility first?

58
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,150
>> Well, one huge thing is that there
is a large population of people

59
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,310
with disabilities.

60
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,210
There's a lot of great research out
there about the demographics of people

61
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:31,090
and we compiled some research and
noted that there are more people with

62
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,950
color blindness than there are native
English speakers in the world.

63
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,670
>> Oh wow.
>> So this is a huge population.

64
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,220
>> Yeah.

65
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,290
And just thinking as an entrepreneur,
that's a huge pool of people, and

66
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,610
an audience that you can tap into
from a financial profit standpoint.

67
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,920
Obviously, another motivator if
you're looking to get involved

68
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,225
in education or government.

69
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:54,230
>> Mm-hm.
>> There's some legal considerations

70
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,620
there and some legal standards
that you need to meet.

71
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,090
But I think most importantly, what we
have found is that, when you consider

72
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,750
accessibility up front, it often leads
to a much better product for everybody.

73
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,510
>> Yeah.

74
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,750
And what's one example of a product
like that that you've seen?

75
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,760
>> Well,
one really simple simple example and

76
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,670
a straightforward thing that everyone
can start doing if you're designing

77
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,820
a digital product,
is think about can a user

78
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,950
complete all the necessary tasks on
your product using just a keyboard.

79
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,480
So, not only is this beneficial to
somebody that uses a screen reader or

80
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,300
doesn't have the dexterity to use
a mouse, but it's also really powerful,

81
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,690
or useful, for
the power users that you might have.

82
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,290
>> Yeah.
>> That like to use keyboards,

83
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,770
because they feel it's more efficient.

84
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,300
>> Mm.

85
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,800
Cool.
