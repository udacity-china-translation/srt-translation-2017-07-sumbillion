1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,910
We're here with Nadya again, and

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,900
we're going to talk about
the stages of design sprint.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,130
But let's first talk about
what is a design sprint?

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,240
>> Well that's a great question.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,890
Design sprints started at Google
about five years ago, and since

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,820
then have become a powerful movement
that helps product teams at Google,

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,630
our developers and companies in the
industry, solve design problems quickly.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,180
>> And
what are the stages of a design sprint?

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,960
>> So a design sprint always
starts in the planning stage.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,560
That's potentially
the most important one.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,810
The design sprint is run by
a person called a sprint master.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,010
We found that sprints that have
a designated person who's in charge of

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,540
the event, and in charge of the team
lead to much higher satisfaction and

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,260
to be much higher deliverables.

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,060
So we always want to have a point
person who is organizing.

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,270
This could be the PM on your team, or
this could be your CEO, this could be

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,970
the designer, or it could be you,
regardless of whatever role you play.

18
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,190
The role of the sprint master is first
to identify the challenge that the team

19
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,500
should be solving.

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,820
If that is not clear, it's very hard for
anyone to make progress.

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,210
Second, the role of the sprint
master is to assemble the team.

22
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,110
We want to invite all the right talent,
and that's the most important part.

23
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,650
If you don't have a team,
the sprint doesn't really happen.

24
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,400
One of the benefits of the sprints
is that you don't always have

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,200
all the talent that you want,
but you can get them.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,090
Because the sprints are short,

27
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,430
you can invite people who
are not from your team.

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,270
So for example, if you and I are running
a sprint, and we didn't have a designer

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,720
or researcher, we could ask one of our
colleagues who is in another team or

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,590
another company, to join us for
two to five days.

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,550
No one wakes up in the morning
hoping to have a boring day.

32
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,410
And when you invite them on a sprint,
they usually say yes.

33
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,850
And they have fun, and they help
you solve something quickly, and

34
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,272
really benefit your team.

35
00:01:51,272 --> 00:01:54,438
>> And
what are the next stages after planning?

36
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:58,475
>> Okay, so the design sprint framework
is based on the understanding of design

37
00:01:58,475 --> 00:01:59,104
thinking.

38
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:02,407
So anyone who is a designer might
find these things familiar and

39
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:04,670
very comfortable to practice.

40
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,630
The good news is that if you've never
practiced design, this is very,

41
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,190
very easy to learn.

42
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,990
Generally, there's six problem-solving
stages of design sprints.

43
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,110
The first is designing the challenge.

44
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,370
You have to do that.

45
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,920
Once you have done with that,

46
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,180
you start six problem-solving
ways of attacking this challenge.

47
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,760
The first is to understand.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,520
Understanding a challenge is very,
very important.

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,780
There's a great quote that I love
that says, first seek to understand,

50
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,240
then to be understood.

51
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,350
Many teams fail because
they start attacking their

52
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,410
products based on the solutions
that they have in their heads.

53
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,450
And they do not understand the customer,
the requirements and

54
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,900
technology that they have.

55
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,780
So what you recommend in sprint
is to start with lightning talks.

56
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,810
You quickly want to hear from everybody
in the team that can represent

57
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,100
a particular perspective, and
generally the most useful are three.

58
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,440
First, you want to hear
about the business goals.

59
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,750
We believe that good
design is good business.

60
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,120
And we always invite
the stakeholders of the business to

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,790
tell us about their objectives.

62
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,770
In a startup,
that may be the CEO of the company, or

63
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,280
it could be someone who's
really in charge of revenue.

64
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,060
>> Right.

65
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,760
>> It's useful to have them there.

66
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,600
They can bring valuable perspective so

67
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,230
that the designers are not running
away from the goals of the company.

68
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,740
Second, we want to hear
from the engineers.

69
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,920
Designers and engineers go together
like peanut butter and jelly.

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,270
You need them in the room, because,
if the designers create something that

71
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,660
the engineers cannot deliver,
it sort of doesn't matter.

72
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,140
So the engineers are there to tell
us what is feasible right now,

73
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,890
what is the code able to achieve?

74
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,760
And what are they able to do, sort of,
within the parameters of this print?

75
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,630
So this is a business stakeholder's
technology, what's missing?

76
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,840
Well, you can create a startup, but

77
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,780
you cannot create an audience if you
don't have a perspective of the user.

78
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,720
So what's really important
is to bring a perspective

79
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,090
that tells the sort of potential
users of the product that we have.

80
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,580
A lot of companies are not sure of
who their perspective user is, so

81
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,680
it's useful to invite the first
kind of ideas that you have about

82
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,300
who might this be impacting.

83
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,680
And if you're not sure,
you can invite different groups.

84
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,250
For example, if you're creating
a news app, you can invite people

85
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,150
who are news reader and
read the New York Times on paper, and

86
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,280
people who love reading
the newspapers on their iPad.

87
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,640
And then people who don't
read the news at all.

88
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,635
And by learning what each group needs,

89
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:34,184
you're able to tackle
a quite broad set of users.

90
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:36,961
By hearing their opinions
in the beginning,

91
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:41,712
reviewing user research that's relevant,
and talking to users directly,

92
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:44,649
the sprint becomes so
much more well informed.

93
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:48,270
And the chances that they'll miss
something are so much lower.

94
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,150
>> Very cool.

95
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,120
So we talked about understanding, and
we talked about planning before that.

96
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,810
What is the next stage?

97
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,020
>> That's a great question.

98
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,846
The design sprint in the series of
intellectual motions that allows us to

99
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:03,462
open their minds and then focus again.

100
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:08,226
We believe that we shouldn't just jump
through solution we should learn as much

101
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:11,353
as possible and
then focusing on the best choices and

102
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:14,010
through that we end up
with better results.

103
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,030
After the distant phase, which opens
everybody's mind, we have another phase,

104
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,750
which is about definition.

105
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,710
That is the phase that helps the team
understand what is the strategy they

106
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,890
want to pursue.

107
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,720
So, at this stage, we tend to look at
the user journey that we want to take

108
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,290
the user on, so, for example, if we're
creating an onboarding flow, this may

109
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,160
look at the major steps along the way of
someone signing up for a new service.

110
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,540
Or, if you're creating a new product,
this may take you from all the stages

111
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:48,140
that are key to someone learning about
your product, discovering it, the first

112
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:53,510
time they use it, the first time they
return, and what we wish to everyone is

113
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,250
that users become their master
powerful evangelizers, where they're

114
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,030
coming over and over to the product,
and they're really enjoying using
