00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,480
You've heard a lot about UX design and

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,120
I'd like to discuss where we are in
the course and what you can expect next.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,520
You've learned about the definition of
user experience from Richard Fulcher and

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,130
you learned the importance of designing
with accessibility in mind from

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,530
the very start.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,050
The rest of this lesson is setup, so

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,150
that you can see examples of
great user experience design.

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,073
And hopefully,
you'll start to gather ideas for

9
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:21,456
what your product might look like.

10
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:24,614
Ultimately, this lesson will
help you think like a designer.

11
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:28,290
It will help you prepare and plan your
own design sprints in lesson three.
