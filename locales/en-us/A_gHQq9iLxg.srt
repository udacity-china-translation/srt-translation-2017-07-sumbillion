Hi, I'm here with Richard Fulcher.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,850
Richard is a UX Designer at Google.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,930
Senior UX Designer?

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,370
>> That's right
>> And has been working on UX for

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,480
the last 15 years.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,720
Thank you for joining us, Richard.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,340
>> Oh, it's a pleasure to be here today,
thanks for having me.

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,940
>> To get started, can you describe
what user experience design is?

9
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,840
>> Sure, it's a big umbrella
of several related disciplines

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,180
that are all focused on
the design of experiences

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,630
to help a individual person
achieve some kind of goal.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,642
And that covers a lot of different
types of experiences, most commonly we

13
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:42,173
think about software design, but it's
also things like environment design, and

14
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:44,392
maybe the design of physical products.

15
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:47,271
It can even be things
like event coordination.

16
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:50,902
It's kind of anything
that a user experiences,

17
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:53,770
that can be constructed for them.

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,760
When I was kind of first taught this,
there was kind of five key concepts.

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,250
It's the study of users and
their context,

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,840
kind of the environment they operate in,
in order that we can design tools for

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,370
them achieve tasks that
let them complete goals.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,070
So users, contexts, tasks.

23
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,620
>> And goals.

24
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,770
>> Goals.

25
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,550
>> Okay, so let's start with the user.

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,900
Who are they?

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,520
Well, the user is anyone

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,890
who's going to use the product of
the service that you're designing.

29
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,200
And it's really important to remember
that, that runs a really wide range.

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,080
It's very easy to kind of,
when you're designing,

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,685
just think about designing for yourself.

32
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:40,820
For this one super idealized
user that you have in mind.

33
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,060
But in reality,
you're going to be building this for

34
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,130
people with very different
levels of experience.

35
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,130
With different contexts and
different backgrounds that affect

36
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,810
how they'll perceive this
thing that you built for them.

37
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,490
>> How do I know who the user is?

38
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,335
>> The key for
that is something called user research.

39
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:03,990
I think it's kind of most
associated with this idea of,

40
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,389
taking this product you're working
on and testing it in some way,

41
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:14,710
having a user come in and try to perform
a series of tasks that you assign them.

42
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,360
And see how they do and see the things
that are problems for them.

43
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,390
But user research really
covers the whole end-to-end

44
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,950
development of the product.

45
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,984
Even before you've drawn
your first screen,

46
00:02:25,984 --> 00:02:30,883
you can engage with user research to
go into your potential users' homes or

47
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:35,397
workplaces, to start to understand
that context that's important

48
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:38,853
to the way that they behave and
what their goals are.

49
00:02:38,853 --> 00:02:41,747
And once you've even kind
of finished and shipped,

50
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:45,560
you can do things like look at logs and
try to analyze usage patterns,

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,076
see what people are doing
with your product.

52
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:51,865
Perhaps kind of bias towards things
that you want them to do more of, or

53
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:56,249
see areas that they're spending a lot of
time in that you haven't anticipated.
