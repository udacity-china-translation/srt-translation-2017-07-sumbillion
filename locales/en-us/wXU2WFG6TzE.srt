00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,170
HI, everyone, I'm here with Yunha,
who's a founder of Locket.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,360
And I'll also be speaking to her
co-founder Kashik later in the course.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,560
Yunha, can you tell me
a little bit about Locket and

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,940
sort of how you got started?

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,640
>> Sure.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,930
So it's a company that's two years old.

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,880
I used to work in investment bank, and
that was my first job out of college.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,170
And the idea was this lock screen that
we're staring at 150 times per day,

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,470
it's nothing better than just
a photo and a clock, currently.

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,310
Can we do something better
than that was the idea?

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,290
So then I quite my job promptly, and
then I started building the team.

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,692
So that's where I found
my co-founder Kashik.

13
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:40,890
And then we moved into
a two-bedroom apartment.

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,290
Where I lived with five other guys and
three dogs, and living out

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,410
of the bedrooms and working out of the
living room, so that's how we started.

16
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,875
And the V1 model was to, hey can
we show ads on the lock screen and

17
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:59,310
get paid from advertisers and pay users
to just rent out the lock screen?

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,860
So that was our initial start.

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,890
It started off as a very Ramen Noodle
startup, kind of like a project.

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,820
And then it just suddenly
became a company,

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,150
after we started fundraising and such.

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,970
>> Great, and
how was the early user adoption?

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,960
How did you guys start finding users and
getting that traction?

24
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,450
>> It was very abrupt.

25
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,620
We thought that we would get like
10,000 users in the first month and

26
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,500
that's how we calculated all these
other ad sales and all that stuff.

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,080
We ended up getting 25,000
users on the first day.

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,840
And then we ended up getting like
a million users from that V1 model.

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,440
>> Wow.

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,680
>> Which ended up failing.

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,350
Which is why we pivoted
into a different model.

32
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,610
Which is showing compound
on the lock screen.

33
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,020
The app is launched,

34
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,200
it's called LockIt, and
it's launched in the Google Play store.

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,210
It will show relevant
news on your lock screen.

36
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,420
Every time you wake up your phone
it'll show different news, so

37
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,410
that you're keeping the know.

38
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,554
>> Great.
And so you originally had the product

39
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:04,817
which was ads-based, and then you moved
into news because you thought that was

40
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:08,651
bigger traction it was something that
was in demand and people wanted.

41
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:13,364
>> So, the way in which our thought
process worked was we couldn't pay, so

42
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:16,990
when we were doing
the paper ad swap model.

43
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,990
What happen was because we got so
many users in a short period of time.

44
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,890
It was impossible for us to plan out
the next ad cycle, because without

45
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,400
knowing how many millions of
users we'll have the next month,

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,430
it was impossible to
sell the ads in advance.

47
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,830
Also, not only that because
advertisers pay us three months

48
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,750
after the ad campaigns
have been finished.

49
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,001
So we were in business of paying
users first before getting paid from

50
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:43,720
advertisers.

51
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,430
>> Yeah.

52
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,230
>> So we needed to raise a lot,
like millions of dollars.

53
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,950
And we're just like a three
months old company.

54
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,640
>> Yeah.

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,030
>> So we had to make a decision.

56
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,140
We're not going to do this anymore.

57
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,760
Then what is the other type of value
that we can provide on the lock screen.

58
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,043
And the idea was, okay,
we just tried out the economics model

59
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:04,080
which is like paying and
rewarding users.

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,670
Can we deliver the right content at
the right time to our users that way?

61
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,640
When we're pivoting we showed,
we were just testing out by

62
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,210
showing some of these other articles
like Justin Bieber just went to jail or,

63
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:24,310
did you know that this airplane had x,
y and z?

64
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,940
And the engagement on those
articles were really great, so

65
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,250
then we went to talk to these meetup
companies who wanted to partner us and

66
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,335
to distribute the content.

67
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:36,776
So that's kind of like the transition
in which we kind of made.

68
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:41,010
And also user base changed a little bit
too, because when we were paying users,

69
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,949
it was the users that really
valued that $3 to $5 per month.

70
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:46,810
Whereas as we were moving
toward the content model,

71
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,630
it's the users that
are hungry to learn more.

72
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,730
>> Yeah.
>> And just get this content.

73
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,230
>> Interesting.
