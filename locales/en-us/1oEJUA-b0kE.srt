1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:04,919
So the command that we're
looking for starts with curl,

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,250
and it ends with the tinyurl.com
URL that we were talking about.

3
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,830
But before that, we want
to follow redirects,

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,579
and we want to save
it as dictionary.txt.

5
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:22,159
See that little progress meter.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,696
And there we go.

7
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:25,279
By the way, you might
notice that I've

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,679
been putting single quotes
around all these URLs.

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,019
The reason for that
is that a lot of URLs

10
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,600
have special characters in them,
such as the ampersand sign,

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,849
and so it's a good idea to
get in the habit of putting

12
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:37,849
single quotes around them, even
if in these particular cases

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,689
it would work fine
just to not do that.
