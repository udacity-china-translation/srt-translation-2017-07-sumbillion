1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,469
Once users have accessed
your homepage or

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:06,640
your application, you'll likely want
the user to register for an account.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,300
But this isn't always the case.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,170
You should keep in mind that
registration doesn't have to be the next

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,410
immediate step in your process.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,210
You should think carefully about
the entire user experience,

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,940
the product you're offering, and

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,390
when you want registration to happen, if
you want registration to happen at all.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,450
Registration on Udacity's site is fairly
simple with just a couple fields or

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,740
you could also login using Facebook or
Google.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,759
For more detailed
examples of sign ups and

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,060
onboarding, check out useronboard.com,
which is linked in the instructor notes.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,910
You can walk through examples such as,

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,420
Gmail to see all the design elements
that guide first time users.

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,220
These details include animations
text annotations, tool tips, and

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:54,000
cause to action, all of these lead the
user to successfully using the product

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,220
for the first time.

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,010
Now, there are many ways to build out
a successful onboarding experience.

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,200
And our best piece of advice is
to test your ideas with users

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,290
using wireframes and mockups.

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,900
We'll cover how you can do this with
a design sprint in the next lesson.

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,680
To get a real sense of
why testing is important,

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,570
check out this article
about Yammer sign up flow.

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,100
The company found very
counter-intuitive results by adding

25
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,180
just one step to the registration flow.
