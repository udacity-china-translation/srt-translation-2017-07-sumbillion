1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,630
So what do you do to
improve your metric?

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,230
>> Iterate, right?

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,720
Talk to your users and change.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,070
If something's not working,
there's a reason it's not working.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,380
I think the worst thing that happens
when metrics aren't going well.

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,780
The two worst things I would say that
people do when their metrics aren't

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,340
moving in the right direction.

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,480
They stick their heads in the sand and
say,

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,340
no, I understand better
than anyone else.

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,090
So I'm just keep down the same path.

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,910
Which typically doesn't work
because you're getting signals and

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,540
the other worst thing that people
do is people switch metrics.

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,110
People say, oh well I know we were
suppose to focus on revenue but

14
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,080
it's not growing so
we're going to to focus on users.

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,370
Because they focus on, or press or
money raised or something.

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,760
Because that's something they can
point to as a sign of success,

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,130
because honestly, it's really,
really hard to admit that you're not

18
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,150
doing something right and that you're
failing, especially as an entrepreneur.

19
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,960
Because your ego is actually
pretty important, again,

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,830
to push you through those walls.

21
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,180
But you can't let it get
in the way of change.

22
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,510
You have to understand what
you're getting wrong and fix it.

23
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,210
>> And when you iterate you do A/B
testing or any other type of testing?

24
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:07,748
>> It depends.

25
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:11,550
I mean A/B testing is
specifically really about

26
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,660
changing something on your website.

27
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,660
Doing two different versions to
see what happens to click rates,

28
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,140
if you have a different picture,
or something like that.

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,250
So that can be useful, but typically
you need to go deeper than that, right?

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,390
You have to tinker with
the guts of what you're doing.

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,060
If you're losing customers,

32
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,210
because your server load times are too
slow A/B testing won't help you there.

33
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,420
You actually have to
re-engineer what you've built.

34
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,690
If you have the completely
wrong features, A/B testing.

35
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,650
You know, you could do
the thing that we used to do,

36
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,410
which was put the dead link and
see if people click on it.

37
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,750
That's a form of A/B testing.

38
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,470
>> Right.
>> But then you have

39
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,190
to build a whole new thing.

40
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,100
And, I think about A/B testing
as incredibly powerful,

41
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,190
but very much about incrementalism.

42
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,470
A lot of the the time when it comes
to iterating your product you have to

43
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,490
take leaps.

44
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,200
So this is actually, I think,

45
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,370
something I didn't say before, which
is listen to your customers feedback.

46
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,720
We don't build exactly what they say.

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,740
You have to make the intuitive leap from
the feedback you get to what they're

48
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,315
going to need in the future and what
they're going to want in the future.

49
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:14,110
A/B testing won't get you there.

50
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,030
Strong product vision will.

51
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,350
>> So
when do you know that you can launch?

52
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,070
>> There's no way to know.

53
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,930
I think precisely, I think the main
thing is just launch already, right.

54
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,620
If you've built that thing,

55
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,660
that is useful, even in the smallest
way to your users, put it out there.

56
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,850
Because if you wait for

57
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,360
some sort of monolithic launch,
you're going to be too late.

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,430
I think this is one of the key
differences between how start-ups launch

59
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,060
and how software is made today
versus ten or 15 years ago.

60
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,720
There's a great book about Intuit.

61
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,850
I'm totally blanking on
the name of the book,

62
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,430
but it's sort of the story of Intuit and
how they beat Microsoft Money.

63
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,710
Because they did, which was crazy.

64
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,770
That the small startup beat Microsoft.

65
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,080
And I remember very distinctly you know
they had to launch a useful product, and

66
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,731
it's tough because it was you know
accounting software and tax software.

67
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:08,510
Oh I think it wasn't tax
software at that point,

68
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,450
it was Personal Money Management
software.

69
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,160
And it needed a lot, and
they did this Herculean effort.

70
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,410
To get the whole thing done and
the CTO worked for

71
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,960
a week without sleep kind of thing.

72
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,400
And the reason they had to do that
is because they actually had to

73
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,360
press floppy disks, right.

74
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,070
You had to get the software
onto a floppy disk and

75
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,380
making the whole company came
in to press floppy disks.

76
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,900
And one of the times they did this there
was a bug they realized afterwards.

77
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,310
They all came back the next weekend,
repressed them, sent them out.

78
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,820
And so that was this idea that you
had to be ready to launch kind and

79
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,310
like really ready with everything done.

80
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,230
And what that lead to was a hell
of a lot of up front investment

81
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,650
with no idea whether or
not the product would work.

82
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,530
Now, because of the internet,

83
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,040
you can basically deploy something
smaller and then add to it over time.

84
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,570
And so, we tell startups again and
again and again, just launch something.

85
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,690
Because, a lot of the time,

86
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,760
the thing that you think will be the
next step in your company's life isn't,

87
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,840
and you won't know it unless you're
interacting with customers, so.

88
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,300
>> So, a lot of entrepreneurs want
to wait until they're feature ready.

89
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,270
>> Oh, yeah.
>> Until the last mile feature is done?

90
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,540
>> That they have the right
number of pixel padding.

91
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,240
We're talking crazy things.

92
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,120
>> Right.
>> Where people are delaying a launch

93
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,630
because they want a very specific
graphic they hired someone to do.

94
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,820
Nobody cares if you have that graphic,
right.

95
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,980
They care whether or not the product
works and does something for us.

96
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,390
>> Right, and what are, for example,

97
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:40,410
the bad things that you forget to do
in launch, or should wait to launch.

98
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,880
>> Well it has to work.

99
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,680
Sometimes people will focus too
much say on visual design and

100
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,330
the thing won't work.

101
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,810
It just won't load,
you hit a button and nothing happens.

102
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,330
That's the worst thing that you
can possibly do because you get

103
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,310
one chance to make a first impression
on someone and it better be good.

104
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,010
On the other hand, you can launch
as many times as you want.

105
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,190
Right?
No one will remember you

106
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,580
launched if they never saw it.

107
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,270
>> Right.
>> So it's okay

108
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,990
just to put it out there.

109
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,720
It doesn't have to be
a big splashy thing,

110
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,250
just put it out there, see what happens
and keep launching until people notice.

111
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,480
>> And start to learn.

112
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,150
>> And start to learn about you, right?

113
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,490
So every time you got a new feature,
you launched, right,

114
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,530
you're launching fresh until you hit
that point where people know about you.
