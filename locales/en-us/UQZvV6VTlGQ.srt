1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,870
OK, let's talk about Windows.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,900
If you're using a Mac or
Linux or some other Unix-based

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,600
system, you can just skip
this page completely.

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:11,640
Just go on to the next page.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,140
Great.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,600
So everyone who's watching,
you're on Windows, right?

7
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:15,500
Cool.

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,969
So what we want
to do for you now

9
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:19,820
is to get you a
Unix-style shell.

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,250
Well, what do I mean
by "Unix-style"?

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,740
Well, I mean it's compatible
with the shells used

12
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:26,750
on Linux and other
Unix-like systems,

13
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,870
which is what the majority
of web servers run on.

14
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,990
Windows comes from a different
lineage of operating systems

15
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,690
than Linux, so it takes
a little extra effort

16
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:38,390
to get Windows compatible
with the rest of the world.

17
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,310
But that's OK.

18
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,770
The most popular Unix-style
shell for Windows

19
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,550
is the one that comes with the
Git Version Control software.

20
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:48,029
It's called Git Bash.

21
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,050
And to install it,
we'll install Git.

22
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:57,739
So go to git.scm.com
and download Git.

23
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,579
I'm just going to click
through this installer.

24
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:01,809
Next.

25
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,920
Sure.

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,480
These all sound great.

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,040
I'll do that.

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,140
When I get to this page
about adjusting your path

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,590
environment, I'm just going to
accept the default. Default's

30
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,150
good here, too.

31
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,400
And now it's asking me
what terminal emulator

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,565
I want to use with Git Bash.

33
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:25,310
I'm going to choose the default
here as well, which is MinTTY.

34
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,490
Defaults are good there, too.

35
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:29,679
Just going to wait
for that to install.

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,010
This can take a few minutes,
but we're going to speed this up

37
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,469
so you don't have to
watch the whole time.

38
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:37,819
You'll be seeing enough of
it on your own computer.

39
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:38,319
OK.

40
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,589
We're done.

41
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,060
And now we have a
program called Git Bash.

42
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,040
Let's run that.

43
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,400
And here we go a--
terminal window.

44
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,900
Hmm.

45
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,460
It's a little bit hard to read.

46
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:49,994
The font's kind of small.

47
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:52,030
I'm going to go in
here and change that.

48
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,211
Ah, much better.

49
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:04,709
Great.

50
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,049
Now that that's set up, let's
take a look at what we've

51
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,198
got going on here.
