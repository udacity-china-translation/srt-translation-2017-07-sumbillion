1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,422
Keeping persona's in mind when
you're designing a product,

2
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:05,693
how does accessibility
play in the persona's?

3
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:10,097
>> Well, like with all persona's you
want those to be based on information

4
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:11,840
from talking to real users.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,440
And so again, is no different here.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,070
So you want to go out and actually talk
with people that have these impairments.

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,858
And when you're developing your persona,
some key pieces of information that you

8
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:25,860
want to include are,
what is their impairment?

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,430
What is the severity of it?

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,600
How do they kind of tackle and

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,910
get through their daily
challenges with the impairment?

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,470
What are certain assistive
technologies that they use?

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,570
What's or how experienced are they
with those assistive technologies?

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,460
What's their skill level?

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,702
>> Mm-hm.

16
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:49,765
>> You want to talk about what
are their pain points in trying

17
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:54,350
to achieve tasks that
are related to your product.

18
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,290
The whole goal is just to really
try to get in some important

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,930
insights into how they go
about completing tasks,

20
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,050
and what are some of their different
approaches that they might take that

21
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,650
maybe other users that you've
already spoken to haven't.

22
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,790
>> And what if I don't have
access necessarily to someone who

23
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,430
has an impairment, like who else could I
contact, or how may I get that insight?

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,860
>> Well, you'd be surprised at
because there is a wide range

25
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,710
of impairments like again,

26
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,370
if somebody that has just kind of lower
vision versus somebody that's completely

27
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,390
blind, you probably do know somebody
with some sort of impairment.

28
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,250
And just thinking about
an older relative maybe that

29
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,060
has lost a bit of their vision or
has arthritis and

30
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,670
their level of dexterity
isn't as what it use to be

31
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,380
that's really valuable in sites that you
can talk to them about or somebody who's

32
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,230
not a native speaker of the language
that's prominent in your app.

33
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,900
They have to kind of approach
things in a different way too,

34
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,070
that could be really insightful.

35
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,810
So there's a lot of people
out there that you might not

36
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,889
immediately consider talking to,
that would be really valuable.

37
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,050
>> Great.

38
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,120
What companies have you seen that
have been designing for all users and

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,440
especially with those with impairments?

40
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,850
>> So,
stepping out of the digital world for

41
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,750
a minute, I think two great examples are
the Bradley Watch, which is right here.

42
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,030
The Bradley Watch was designed
from the get go thinking about

43
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,710
people with impairments, at least with
the visual impairments in particular.

44
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,030
And so what this watch allows
you to do is tell time

45
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,900
with just feeling the watch.

46
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,200
And you can see there's two magnetic
balls here that indicate the hour and

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,510
the minute, and
this is obviously great for

48
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,010
people with disabilities in that
it helps them tell the time, but

49
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,170
it also is visually appealing,
it's very aesthetically pleasing.

50
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,780
And it doesn't look like anything
very different than other watches.

51
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,220
So it doesn't draw attention
to their disability,

52
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,900
which is always an added bonus
to these types of devices.

53
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,450
But then just thinking about in
situations where if you are sighted,

54
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,280
you might be in a dark movie theater,
or in a meeting,

55
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,960
or discussion where you don't
want to take your gaze away and

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,230
you want to still understand what
time it is, it's really valuable.

57
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:18,920
>> Yeah, that's great.

58
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,540
>> Yeah, so you can see, this is
a great example of thinking about

59
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,550
those needs upfront and coming up
with a great product for everybody.

60
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,870
>> And the other one was Oxo.

61
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,300
>> Yes, and so,
Oxo design is that they have a whole

62
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,380
design team that focus on universal
design, which we talked about before.

63
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,750
And some of their products always have,

64
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,200
are always keeping in
mind different needs.

65
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,800
And so some examples are, they talk
about this again on their website where

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,280
they can use a basalts
bender with one hand, or

67
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,787
their measuring cups are really unique,
in that you don't have to kind of

68
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:57,610
bend down to see where
the liquid is measuring.

69
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,450
You can look over and
see where the numbers are.

70
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,940
So they take a lot of
things into consideration.

71
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,060
Again, it benefits all users,
not just those with disabilities.

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,570
>> And to wrap up, what are you
final thoughts on accessibility?

73
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,070
>> I'd like to say that yes,
it can be daunting.

74
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,120
It can be time-consuming if it's left
to the end of the design development

75
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,649
process.

76
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,920
There's always a lot of retrofitting and

77
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,860
rethinking that needs to happen
if it's left to the end.

78
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,070
There's no doubt about it.

79
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,860
So, to save everyone time and
pain, think about it early.

80
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,000
Think about throughout
the entire process and

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,830
just incorporate it into
your existing process.

82
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,810
And in the end,
not only will you have saved time.

83
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,550
But you will also come up with
a much better product that's usable

84
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,070
for everybody.
