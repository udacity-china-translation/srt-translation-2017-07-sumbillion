00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,910
We're here with Nadya Direkova,
a staff designer at Google and a design

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,520
print master will run more design print
more than anyone else in the company.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,384
Thank you for joining us.

4
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,840
>> Thank you for having me.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,080
>> So, when should an entrepreneur
think of design and

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,780
user experience when
building their product?

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,640
>> That's a great question.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,060
The answer is right away, I don't
believe that there is a successful

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,840
product that separate
from being a product or

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
something that's carefully designed.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,750
So as soon as someone's thinking
about starting a company,

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,140
it's useful to think about what is it
they want to bring to the world, and

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,800
that starts the design process.

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,500
>> Right, and
when you don't have a designer or

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,150
you can't afford
a designer what do you do?

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,369
>> So we'd like to believe that anyone
can have some of the skills that

17
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:48,140
a designer has.

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,390
Note the skills in Photoshop
actually rendering beautiful mocks.

19
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,290
But the kinds of questions
that the designer asks,

20
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,730
we're hoping to cover some of
these today so that you can learn,

21
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,230
what are the design skills that can
help you quickly tackle your product and

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,880
the chief results with your team,
even if you're not a designer.

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,090
>> You'll hear more about design
spreads from Nadia in the next lesson.
