1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,185
Let's switch gears for a moment to talk about proxies.

2
00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:05,128
The dictionary defines a proxy as...

3
00:00:05,128 --> 00:00:07,584
Hey, I need to give this to Richard.

4
00:00:07,585 --> 00:00:09,740
He's kind of busy right now.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,345
Well, okay. So, can you sign that, please?

6
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:15,800
Yeah, sure.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,030
Here we go.

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:19,031
Thank you.

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,204
Yeah. So the dictionary defines a proxy as something that represents someone else.

10
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:25,494
In ES6...

11
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:27,940
Hey, can I talk to Richard for a second?

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,700
Yeah, hold on.

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,701
Cool.

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,869
Okay.

15
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,829
He said he could be back in like five minutes.

16
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:37,640
Okay, yeah.

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,990
Okay. Where was I?

18
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,130
Oh, right.

19
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,240
Doing ES6 are JavaScript proxies.

20
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,000
A JavaScript proxy will let one object stand in for

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,670
another object to handle all the interactions for that other object.

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,565
The proxy can handle requests directly,

23
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:54,859
pass data back and forth to the target object,

24
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,740
and a whole bunch of other things.

25
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,270
Let's look at how you can create a proxy in JavaScript.
