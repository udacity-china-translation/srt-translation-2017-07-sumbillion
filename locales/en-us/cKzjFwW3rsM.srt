1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,210
Another big piece of the user
experience are notifications.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,183
Notifications allow you to
communicate with the user,

3
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:12,917
and they can take many different forms,
text messages, emails,

4
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:18,260
push notifications, icons,
vibrations, banners, and alerts.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,060
You'll need to think carefully about
how often you notify users and

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,150
what forms those notifications take,

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,630
since they contribute to
the overall user experience.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,780
A graph or matrix like this one can help
you think through the importance and

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,180
urgency of your notifications.

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,940
As I walk through the upcoming examples,
you should think about

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,780
where notifications might
fall on this diagram.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,180
In general, you want to avoid sending
many messages that have low importance

13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,760
and low urgency.

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,970
If you're sending a lot of
these types of messages,

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,200
it can make your product feel spammy.

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,480
Keep in mind that the frequency for a
given notification may change over time,

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,990
and this graph might look different for
different personas using the product.

18
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,130
You should think about
different notifications for

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,069
different personas as you
work on your product.

20
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,800
Some might have preferences for
one notification over others.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,560
In general, there's some key
qualities of notifications

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,930
that you should keep in mind for
your users.

23
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,300
The first one is control.

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,940
And it's the most important thing
that you want to give users.

25
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,910
Little Big Details is a website
that showcases a lot of

26
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,010
awesome user experience.

27
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,370
When it comes to control,

28
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,940
Foursquare in Apple gives users lots
of control through menus like these.

29
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,730
The second is feedback.

30
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,510
Other types of notifications
involve informing the user

31
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,680
about tasks that they are performing.

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,120
This is really just about good
design in user experience.

33
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,220
The feedback provided is
dependent on the product.

34
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,740
And by providing great feedback,
you can make users

35
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,610
feel like you're looking out for them
while making the product more usable.

36
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,390
For example, Twitter will try and

37
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,580
provide feedback if you
send the same tweet twice.

38
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,210
Slack, a messaging app also
provides great feedback to users.

39
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,750
It provides a confirmation
when sending a message

40
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,480
to a channel that has people
in different time zones.

41
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,660
And Amazon provides feedback about
whether someone may have bought you

42
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,280
an item on your Wish List.

43
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,160
All of these notifications
are related to feedback loops for

44
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,170
users to successfully complete tasks.

45
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,280
The third is customization.

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,940
It's a more subtle aspect of
notifications for your users.

47
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,790
You might do this based on time,
task, location or

48
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,630
some other attribute
that's tied to the user.

49
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,420
Facebook for example, shows a different
part of the world to users,

50
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,840
depending on the user's location.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,870
Finally, you can develop notifications
that lead users to form a habit of using

52
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,440
your product depending on the frequency
and any rewards you might give them.

53
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,391
You can tap into what Nir Eyal
describes as variable rewards.

54
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:48,799
GitHub provides variable rewards to its
users by showing a different Octocat

55
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:52,150
each time the user has
no new notifications.

56
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,030
Tumblr sends emails with playful
texts when a user follows someone or

57
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,310
when someone else follows that user.

58
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,450
And, Coffee Meets Bagel,
which is a dating application,

59
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,060
uses digital currency to reward users
for tapping into the dating app.

60
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,420
Each of these qualities contributes
to the user experience and

61
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,880
their perception of your product.
