1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,500
So now that we've done the define stage,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,550
we're moving on to the diverge stage,
right?

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,470
>> The diverge stage is the next one.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,400
The diverge stage is a chance for
everyone to be thinking with their own

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,340
creativity and imagination,
how should this problem be solved?

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,830
>> You said solutions, so
you mean more than one, right?

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,280
>> Yeah,
we're starting to think about solutions.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,260
Not just one.

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,360
Everybody's thinking
about many solutions.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,340
And then the team as a whole is thinking
about whole list of solutions, and

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,120
that makes the team powerful.

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,390
Everyone has time individually
to work on some solutions, and

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,840
as they are ready with this, then they
share it with the team, and suddenly,

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,670
they're looking a whole dessert tray of
options for what the product could be.

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,200
It is so exciting.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,160
One thing that's really exciting about
this stage is how quickly it can happen.

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,490
We do an exercise that's familiar
to some people from Gamestorming.

18
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,010
It is called the Crazy 8's.

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,120
>> Okay, how does that go?

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,230
>> The Crazy 8's?

21
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,160
You want to know?

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,760
Well, here goes.

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,090
The Crazy 8's gives everyone
a little piece of paper.

24
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:08,310
And they ask the team to sketch
eight ideas in five minutes.

25
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,780
Usually, the first reaction that people
have when you ask them to sketch

26
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,170
eight ideas in five minutes,
is they think you're crazy.

27
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,686
And that's why we call it the Crazy 8's.

28
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:18,951
[LAUGH]
>> Nice.

29
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:22,510
>> [LAUGH] As soon as they
answer this question,

30
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,150
they look at the face of the leader,
and when they see that the leader is

31
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:30,180
actually serious, then they return to
the writing and they start sketching.

32
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,970
In five minutes, people are able to do
five, six, seven, sometimes eight ideas.

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,740
That allows them to warm up their mind,

34
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,900
their creative muscles
are starting to flex.

35
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,730
It's kind of like a warmup for
a workout.

36
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,250
After that, we give the team
another piece of paper and

37
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,280
another five minutes and

38
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,590
we say from the ideas that you already
have can you give me one big sketch?

39
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,810
Label it clearly and

40
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,880
explain what are the pieces of
this layout that you're creating.

41
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,940
Some people might be intimidated
by the sketching process.

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,060
This is when we remind them that we're
asking them to sketch simple things.

43
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,540
A grid that's based of rectangles,
syntax labels,

44
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,000
some placeholders for
a pictures and icons should be.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,510
With that reminder, most people
are ready to re-imagine themselves

46
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,400
as the creative child
that they once were.
