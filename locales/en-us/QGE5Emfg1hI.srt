1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,089
The projects package.json file lists all

2
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:06,165
of the NPM packages that this project depends on.

3
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:09,269
This project depends on the babel-cli and

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,234
the es2015 preset that is a collection of all ES6 plugins.

5
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:17,160
So these are the plugins that will be downloaded and installed.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,170
Once they're installed, we need to tell

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,085
the babel-cli which plugins it should use to do the transpiling.

8
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:28,804
The cli will check the bbel rc file for which plugins and presets to use.

9
00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:32,399
So the package.json file lists what should be installed and

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,140
the babel rc file tells babel which plugins to use when it does it's transpiling.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,329
Now that babel knows to use this preset,

12
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,684
we need to tell to actually transpile the code.

13
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:44,340
To do that we've added a build script that will tell

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,400
babel to take the files in the ES6 directory,

15
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,399
transpile them using that ES2015 preset

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
and then put the transformed code in the ES5 directory.
