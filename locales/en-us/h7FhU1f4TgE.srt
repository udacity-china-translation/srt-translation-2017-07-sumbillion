1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,535
So far, you've done a bunch of things with files and directories.

2
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:06,080
But where do files come from in the first place?

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,625
Well, they come from the web.

4
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:10,680
There's a shell command to download a file from the web.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,150
That command is curl,

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,015
that stands for C URL,

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,395
as in see a web page.

8
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:20,260
Whoever named that, ha ha, yes, very funny.

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,835
You can use curl to get any web page,

10
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:25,890
but what it does is to show you the source code to

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,330
the page which is kind of cool but not always directly useful.

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,665
We try to get http://google.com,

13
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:36,840
it's actually showing us some HTML that really wants us to go someplace else.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,814
You need to add a little option to curl,

15
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:41,475
curl dash big L means follow

16
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:46,790
redirects and then we'll see the source code to the actual google.com homepage.

17
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,450
Ha! there we go, this is

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,265
the compressed JavaScript source code to the google.com homepage.

19
00:00:51,265 --> 00:00:52,950
It's got things in there like,

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,255
I'm Feeling Lucky and Google search.

21
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:58,230
This is a lot like what you'd see if you opened up

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,230
the View Source in the browser dev tools.

23
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,430
So, that's kind of handy for checking out web sites,

24
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,850
but curl is very useful for downloading files or pages by URL.

25
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,870
To get it to write to a file instead of displaying to the terminal,

26
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,428
we use the dash little o option.

27
00:01:15,428 --> 00:01:18,570
We say, curl dash little o followed by

28
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,495
the file name that we'd like it to save under, like google.html.

29
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:26,385
This is actually a really common pattern for shell commands.

30
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:29,340
Start with the name of the command followed by

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,574
some options like dash little o google.html

32
00:01:32,574 --> 00:01:35,640
and dash capital L and then followed

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,095
by the object that we actually want to operate on, like the URL.

34
00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:45,030
We run this, curl will show a little progress message while it's downloading.

35
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,910
When it's finished, we just get our shell prompt back.

36
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,250
It's pretty common for Unix programs to not

37
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,765
display any logs or done message if they run successfully.

38
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:56,080
But it did run successfully.

39
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,000
And there's the file that it created, google.html.
