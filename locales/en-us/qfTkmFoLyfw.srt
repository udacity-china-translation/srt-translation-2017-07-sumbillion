00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Welcome back. In this lesson,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,160
we'll explore the latest batch of new built-ins provided in ES6.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,310
We now have sets, maps, promises,

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,790
and a whole new bunch of other built-ins at our disposal.

5
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:13,139
It's taken a while for JavaScript to catch up,

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,929
but these built-ins make it much easier for us to execute

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,835
tasks that were once more difficult in earlier versions of the language.

8
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:21,135
As you go through this lesson,

9
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:23,145
you'll see how these new built-ins are structured,

10
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:26,219
how they work, and when it's the most appropriate time to use them.

11
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,000
To get started, let's kick it off with symbols.
