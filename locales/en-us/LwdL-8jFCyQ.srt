1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,014
You're a pro at JavaScript,

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:05,749
but that does not mean you can just "kick back and coast."

3
00:00:05,748 --> 00:00:09,439
These new additions in ES6 have brought a major change to the language.

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,099
You can not just ignore them in bank on

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,605
your existing knowledge of a now behind-the-times technology.

6
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:16,859
You have got to get up, dig into the features,

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,679
read the specification, follow some tutorials,

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,015
maybe even write some of your own.

9
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:25,440
The Web is an evolving platform and you need to evolve with it.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,929
Imagine being stuck on old horrible equipment when

11
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,149
there are newer nicer tools available for you to use.

12
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:33,479
You now know how JavaScript language improvements are

13
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,344
made and where to find browser support for them.

14
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:38,350
You have got the tools. You just need to use them.
