00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,089
You've probably come across or had to use the mystical "this" keyword.

2
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:06,870
This can be pretty confusing since it's

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,530
a dynamic value that's different depending on how a function is called.

4
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:13,649
Sneak peek with regular functions,

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,705
the value of "this" depends on how the function is called.

6
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:18,203
While with arrow functions,

7
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:21,969
it depends on where that function is located in the code.

8
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:24,695
Let's briefly review how the "this" keyword works

9
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:28,000
