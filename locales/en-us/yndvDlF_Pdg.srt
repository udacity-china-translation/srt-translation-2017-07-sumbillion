1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,700
What makes good notification?

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,840
>> That's a great question.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,040
So a lot of times when I teach people
about the hook model, they say, okay,

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,130
I get the trigger phase,
we need to prompt people to action, but

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,060
how do we make sure that
we don't spam people?

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,160
How do we know we're not sending them
too many of these triggers that they

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,610
become ineffective?

8
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,390
And there's a secret here.

9
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,530
The secret is that we have to
closely couple the external trigger,

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,400
the notification,

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,570
the message that tells the user what
to do with the internal trigger.

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,410
The internal trigger is this situation,
the emotion, the routine,

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,480
the place, whatever it is that prompts
the user to act on their own accord.

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,920
So the closer we can couple
these two things, right?

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,260
The closer we can couple
the notification with the sensation or

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,180
the urge of this is
what I need in my day.

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,260
That's magic.

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,990
That's the difference between magic and
SPAM, is context.

19
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,700
So that's the key.

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,870
If you can closely couple those two,
and that, of course,

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,430
starts with an examination, doing a bit
of a narrative on your user to figure

22
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,680
out when are they most likely to need
this product throughout their day.

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,060
So don't just willy-nilly send
them notifications all day long.

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,519
But couple those
notifications with a time and

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,640
place when your user is most likely
to actually need the solution.

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,410
>> So there's a delightful moment and
you couple it with authentication.

27
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,900
>> Right.
Well it's a moment when

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,020
the user has this need.

29
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,650
So for example, let's say I'm building
an app that plays music, right?

30
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,010
A music service or
a news service, right?

31
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,190
A great time to couple that need
is when I had the existing habit

32
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,315
of turning on my radio.

33
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:28,850
>> Right.

34
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,290
>> So if you could use geolocation or
other data or time of day data, or

35
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,070
appointment calendar information,
something that the user can tell you

36
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,830
about how they behave day to day, so
that you can appropriately target that

37
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,810
trigger at the moment in time
where it feels like magic.

38
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,830
Wow, I was just about
to turn on my radio,

39
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,200
I think I'll use this app instead.
