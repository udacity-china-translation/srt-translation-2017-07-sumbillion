1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,520
At this point, you should be familiar
with personas and wire frames.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,520
Your next task is to create at
least one persona and a user flow.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,220
You can lay out your persona
on a piece of paper like this,

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,470
split up into four quadrants.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,100
Your persona should include
the following information.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,430
A sketch of the person, or a picture of
the person, and their name, demographic

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,980
information, and any behaviors that you
think are relevant to your product.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,690
Here you should include demographic
information that leads to specific

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,690
types of behaviors.

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,630
And here you should put their
pain points and their needs.

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,660
Try to differentiate personas around
pain points, needs, and their behaviors.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,130
By designing your product for
their behaviors or

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,940
their different pain points and needs,
you could really target different users.

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,310
And finally here is where
your product comes into play,

15
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,200
this is where you put all
your solutions for that user.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,700
You can create this persona using any
tool of your choice and I've included

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,855
some additional tools and examples which
are linked in the instructor notes.

18
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:02,725
You can rely on user research
here to help you out.

19
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:04,995
Remember the goal is to
create something quickly.

20
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:07,285
You can revisit this
persona that you create and

21
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:10,927
the user flow when you learn about
design sprints in lesson three.

22
00:01:10,927 --> 00:01:11,917
Create a persona and

23
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:15,877
include a user flow that shows how
a user would complete a task, and

24
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:19,717
how the user would interact in the main
navigation or flows of your product.

25
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:22,957
You can see one example of this which
is linked to the instructor notes.
