Hi, I'm here with Kaushik,
who's one of the co-founders of Locket.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,824
And Kaushik, I'd like to talk to you a
little bit about how you iterate quickly

3
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:12,820
and how do you do user testing to make
sure that you have a good product?

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,930
>> Oh sure.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,830
So, once we come up with
the product feature or

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,330
something which we want to build and
try testing it out on our user base.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,990
We quickly list out
all the action items.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,290
And then, we talk to all the people
who are very close to us, and

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,090
see what their feedback is.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,240
And then,
we iteratively build on top of it.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,948
We start off from a very, very small
feature addition to current app,

12
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:39,286
or we build a very small MVP.

13
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:43,604
And then, we test the technology from
users, get their feedback, try to track

14
00:00:43,604 --> 00:00:47,285
their metrics and see if it is going
in the positive direction or no.

15
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:50,556
If it is going in the positive
direction, then we take it up,

16
00:00:50,556 --> 00:00:54,255
improve it, or we remove all
the features which are not doing good.

17
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:54,856
>> Mm-hm.
>> And

18
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:58,585
that way we iterate a couple of times
to get to a place where we can release

19
00:00:58,585 --> 00:00:59,406
an test it out.

20
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:02,619
>> Yeah, and you talked a little
bit about how you'll contact maybe

21
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:04,580
friends or people in your network.

22
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,929
Are there any other specific users that
you'll make sure to go after to make

23
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:11,901
sure you're hitting
different demographics, or

24
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:15,167
maybe particular people who
have certain phones, or?

25
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,187
>> Well, it totally depends
on the kind of application.

26
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:19,909
For example,
if you are releasing an application for

27
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:23,250
students then we mainly look at
the kind of phones they are using.

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,860
And the main, like what kind of
apps they are already using.

29
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,140
And based on their, interest for

30
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,200
the UI, as well as based
on their utilization ways.

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,730
We come up with the features and

32
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,482
organize it in such a way
that it will appeal to them.

33
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:41,480
And we also make sure that
the UI is very animated and

34
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,430
very focused to that
particular demographic.

35
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,518
For example, if you are targeting
mid 40s or something,

36
00:01:47,518 --> 00:01:51,150
we don't really need to make it
really colorful and very animated.

37
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,870
But if we are talking to
someone like 14 or 15,

38
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,380
then we want to keep it really
engaging and really interesting.

39
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,820
So, based on all these features,
we come up with a list of things.

40
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,819
Which we try to get people into
the workplace and see how they use it or

41
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,758
how they respond to that.

42
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,530
And from there on, build on top of it.
