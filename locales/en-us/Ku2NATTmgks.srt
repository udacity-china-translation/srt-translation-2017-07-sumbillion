00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,363
You've probably heard the term compiler before.

2
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:05,339
A compiler is a computer program that

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,674
takes a program written in some source code language,

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:12,629
let's say C++, and then converts it to a target language like machine code.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,795
Running code through a compiler changes its level of abstraction,

6
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:20,460
how close it is to human readable code to machine runnable code.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,455
So that's compiling, taking a source language

8
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:24,508
and converting it into a lower level language.

9
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:27,545
Transpiling is a subset of compiling.

10
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:30,510
So, it takes source code and converts it into target code.

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,030
Just like a compiler but the source code and

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,969
target code are at the same level of abstraction.

13
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,399
Basically, if the source code starts out as human

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,210
readable then the output language will also be human readable.

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,100
But why would we want this?

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,679
Well, we just saw that older browsers do not

17
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,600
fully support ES6 but they do support ES5 code.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,459
This way we could write our JavaScript using ES6,

19
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:59,559
syntax and functionality and then use a transpiler to convert it from ES6 code to ES5.

20
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:01,439
So, we'll write code using the newest and

21
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,000
best but convert it so that it will run everywhere.
