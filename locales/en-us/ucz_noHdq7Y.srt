1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,080
>> So when should an entrepreneur
start thinking about accessibility?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,130
>> From the beginning, immediately.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,705
Even just during the product
conception phase,

4
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:10,974
it's critical to be thinking about this.

5
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:15,252
You should be thinking about how
could this really benefit and

6
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:19,540
improve the life of a user with or
without a disability?

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,529
Thinking about how can my product
be used in various situations?

8
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:25,331
Things like that are very important.

9
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:28,435
I think a good example is Google Books,

10
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:33,040
which was became really
beneficial to everyone in that.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,710
Now that all of these books that
were tucked away in libraries across

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,950
the world were digitized and

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,050
you could see them just by
typing in your computer.

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,180
So now only is it beneficial to you and

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,060
I, but
folks that use screen readers now.

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,777
They are able to use these, have these
books read to them via screen reader,

17
00:00:49,777 --> 00:00:51,983
which in the past,
they would have to wait for

18
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:55,377
a braille version, which are very
costly and time consuming to get.

19
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:59,984
So this is a great example of
why it's important to think of

20
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:01,684
these things early.

21
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:04,272
>> So how do you go about designing for
all users and

22
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:08,550
what sort of lessons learned from Google
Books or maybe other digital projects

23
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,930
should entrepreneurs be aware of and
know about?

24
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,970
>> So, I think the first
thing is to just for you and

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,303
your team members to become familiar
with accessibility basics and

26
00:01:19,303 --> 00:01:24,108
most importantly is understanding
the needs of users with disabilities.

27
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:26,635
So when you're starting out any project,

28
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:30,493
you want to reach out to users that
you think will be your end user and

29
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:34,440
understand their needs,
their challenges, their pain points.

30
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,055
And so this is the exact same thing
you want to do with people with

31
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:37,772
disabilities.

32
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:40,202
So reaching out to folks
that you feel like,

33
00:01:40,202 --> 00:01:44,474
meet your target audience that also
have impairments is really important and

34
00:01:44,474 --> 00:01:46,916
the insights that you
gain are invaluable.

35
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:50,556
The other thing you want to do is
become more familiar with assistive

36
00:01:50,556 --> 00:01:51,760
technologies.

37
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,132
So, assistive technologies are tools
that a number of people use to just

38
00:01:56,132 --> 00:02:00,362
kind of help them achieve the same
task that other people would with just

39
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:02,097
a little bit of assistance.

40
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:05,935
So examples of this are closed
captioning in videos,

41
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:09,360
where you can see the words
that are being said.

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,502
You see those typed at
the bottom of those.

43
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:15,362
There are magnification
devices that people with

44
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:17,460
low vision might need to use.

45
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,039
There are screen meters,

46
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,998
which essentially read the contents
of the screens to the users.

47
00:02:22,998 --> 00:02:26,519
So you don't have to become
an expert on these, by any means,

48
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:28,493
because that would take forever.

49
00:02:28,493 --> 00:02:32,524
But just understanding the basics,
as well as watching and

50
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:35,290
observing somebody use these.

51
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,840
Specifically, watching them, use the
technologies with your product is again,

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,550
it's one of the most eye opening
experiences I've ever had.

53
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,333
And then I think another thing to keep
in mind is that there are a number of

54
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:53,243
online resources for
accessibility design guidelines,

55
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:58,130
that give you lots of points of what
to consider when you're designing.

56
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,944
So an example might be,
when you're in the visual design stage,

57
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:06,630
you want to be thinking
about good color contrast.

58
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,116
So that users with low vision can
actually read what's on the screen or

59
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:10,775
on the page.

60
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:15,850
When you're thinking about interaction
design, you want to ensure that again,

61
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,624
what we talked about before where the
keyboard users that only use a keyboard

62
00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:25,050
are able to complete all of the tasks
that they're trying to achieve.
