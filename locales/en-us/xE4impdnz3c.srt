00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,484
Nice work completing lesson three.

2
00:00:02,484 --> 00:00:06,125
At this point you've seen almost everything there is to see in ES6.

3
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:08,199
But we still have one more lesson.

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:11,519
You'd think that with all the advancements to Javascript that you'd be able

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,015
to start using every new feature in ES6, right now.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,250
But that's not really the case.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,859
Sometimes there are situations where browsers haven't

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,888
quite caught up to the latest and greatest features in Javascript.

9
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:27,600
In Lesson 4 you'll see how in spite of this you can still write ES6 code that

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,570
is future proof for when browsers catch

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,115
up but will still work for browsers that aren't quite up to snuff.

12
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's put what you've learned to good use in the next lesson.
