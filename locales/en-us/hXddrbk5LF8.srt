Congratulations! You've made it to the end of this course on ES6.

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,470
You mean ES2015, right? Sure, whatever.

3
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:11,248
Look, you've made it to the end of this course on the future of JavaScript.

4
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:15,420
Before you go, let's not forget about the things you've learned during this course.

5
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:17,190
In lesson one, you learned about

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,920
the most recent syntax additions to the JavaScript language.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,225
In lesson two, you discovered

8
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:25,830
new ways for writing functions and how to create JavaScript classes.

9
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:30,539
In lesson three, you were exposed to the latest built-ins provided to you in ES6.

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,969
And, in lesson four,

11
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:37,097
we wrapped it up by showing you how to incorporate ES6 into your next JavaScript project.

12
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:40,140
We hope you found this course to be insightful and it will inspire

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,119
you to start using ES6 in whatever projects you work on in the future.
