1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,960
So now that we understand tasks,
what comes next?

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,640
>> Well, then you actually start
to get drawing the screens.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,460
You get to pick up the pen, or
the white board marker, or the mouse and

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,420
start trying to imagine
what these scenes,

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,810
these environments the user's going
to interact with actually look like.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,590
So you're going back to the tasks and

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,540
kind of figuring out what are the pieces
of information that they need to see.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,100
What are the pieces of
information they need to provide.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,520
How do those all fit together on
the screen to support that task?

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,700
And from there you can kind of
start building one screen and

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,080
maybe a couple of screens
that cover that task.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,718
And then look for connections.

13
00:00:40,718 --> 00:00:44,635
You can start looking for things
that happened earlier to the user,

14
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:46,569
that brought them to this stage.

15
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:49,450
You know, those screens want
to be related in some way.

16
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,590
Or you think about things
that they want to do from

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,890
that point once they complete that task,
well where do they go?

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,296
And as you start to kind of get all
these screens you start to build these

19
00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:00,521
flows and connect them.

20
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:04,551
You have a sense of which things are
really important which things are less

21
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:06,340
important or frequently used.

22
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,770
You start to build out the structure for
this experience.

23
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,110
And you think about the user might come
in this way and spend a lot of time here

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,370
and then hop over into this different
condition and spend time there.

25
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,170
That starts to guide you about how the
overall navigation of that experience

26
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,180
is going to work.

27
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,610
>> And which tool do you
love to use to do that?

28
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,835
>> I love paper and pencil.

29
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:28,164
>> Right.

30
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:32,040
>> But at some point you get more and
more detailed with what you're doing.

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,860
So you can start very coarse.

32
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,720
You can just start with a white board or

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,030
scraps of paper because you
want to kind of fail quickly.

34
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,340
You want to draw out things,
realize what's wrong with them,

35
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,730
crumple them up, and throw them away.

36
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,990
And draw them again.

37
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,200
A lot of what I do as
a designer is iteration.

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,770
And there's a saying that
writing is rewriting,

39
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,030
that applies to design as well.

40
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,790
>> Right.
>> Design is redesigning.

41
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,430
>> So you design it to show it to
someone, you get some feedback, and

42
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,490
then you redesign it.

43
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,630
>> Yeah, absolutely.

44
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,040
And you often will draw
a lot of different things.

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,840
And just kind of get a feel for, from
feedback and from your own experience,

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,810
and from the understanding of the user
that you've built up through all those

47
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,008
other steps.

48
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,350
Which ones are the best bets,
which make the most sense?

49
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,910
And some of that is about making
a choice based on the whole product.

50
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,710
It's good if you can get to a smaller
number of patterns that the user has to

51
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,930
learn rather than the user having
to learn 100 different styles of

52
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,250
working with your app.

53
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:27,750
>> Right.

54
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,530
So when do I know that I'm
done with all these checks?

55
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,227
>> Okay.
So you're never done.

56
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:35,272
That's a joke.

57
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:36,810
That's design.
>> Oh that sounded unfortunate.

58
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,630
>> No sorry.

59
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,840
>> Okay.
>> I mean it's great you could try but

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,520
you're never going to quite get there.

61
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,505
Like there's always going to be
something that you want to change.

62
00:02:45,505 --> 00:02:49,047
You learn something else from
the testing or from putting it out.

63
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:51,865
Or there's some new capability
that comes around that you

64
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:54,875
want to incorporate into the product.

65
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,675
You'll get closer and closer.

66
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:59,645
You'll continue to approach it,
but you'll never quite land there.

67
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:03,050
So you'll kind of go through and
you'll iterate, and you'll redesign, and

68
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,690
you'll go to higher and
higher levels of fidelity.

69
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,008
You'll go from those pencil sketches
to mockups to very polished mockups to

70
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:10,820
prototypes.

71
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,190
And you'll start building
it at some point.

72
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,630
So that said,
there's things you can look for.

73
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,350
>> Okay.
>> You don't have to give up all hope.

74
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,019
>> Okay.
>> So,

75
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,471
have you covered all of those tasks
that you want to address, right?

76
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:29,022
Have you completely solved
the problem you were looking at?

77
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:33,627
Does the product have a point of view
about what things are important and

78
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:34,711
which aren't?

79
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:38,048
You know, if you have the tasks that
are high priority make them feel like

80
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:39,587
they're important to the user.

81
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:42,809
Like stress them so that they know
this is what this product is about.

82
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,890
You've done user testing, right?

83
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,620
>> Of course
>> Okay, so

84
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,460
have you covered all of
the issues that arose from that?

85
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,250
Have you kind of addressed
those high priority items?

86
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,640
And then finally, have you solved
the problem you set out to solve?

87
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,870
You go back to those original goals and

88
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,339
see am I actually meeting what I
understand I need to do for that user?

89
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,581
>> And what would be a good mark or
signal to tell me that I need to move

90
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,960
from design to actually do rapid
prototyping or stuff like that?

91
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,130
>> You should do that
as rapidly as you can.

92
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:20,490
You know, even if you're just testing
things on paper Prototyping it out.

93
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:25,200
Using kind of the simplest
tools that you can do.

94
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,170
You have that analysis phase and
then once you move into design,

95
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:33,860
you know design and prototyping
should be very much hand in hand.

96
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,790
The closer you get to something that
feels like a real experience to a user,

97
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,640
the better feedback you're
going to get from them.

98
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,510
>> Of course.
>> In many cases.

99
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,580
So, you want to get to that
point as rapidly as you can.
