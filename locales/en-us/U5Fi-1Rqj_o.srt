1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,280
Dot voting or zen voting allows you and
your team to zero in on the best ideas.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,920
This activity is actually
a part of the decide stage, but

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,970
it can follow the crazy 8s or
any rapid sketching that you do.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,470
In zen voting, you lay out all
the sketches on a table or

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,120
you tape them to a wall.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,050
Then, you give everyone a limited number
of sticker dots, usually two or three.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,610
And you have people silently pick the
best ideas by placing their sticker dot

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,820
on that sketch.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,050
It's important for the voting to be
silent, so people can choose without

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,340
being easily persuaded by
the loudest person in the room.

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,700
After voting, you and
your team can discuss the best ideas.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,790
Take a minute to think
about your sketches and

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,640
the example sketch that was
provided from the Crazy 8s.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,900
Which two ideas did you like the best?

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,490
