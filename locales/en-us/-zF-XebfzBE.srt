1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,820
The Shell isn't
just a user interface,

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:05,070
it's also a
programming language.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,153
Files containing Shell commands
are called Shell scripts.

4
00:00:09,153 --> 00:00:11,070
These can be as simple
as one or two commands,

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,929
just like you'd write
at the Shell prompt.

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,910
Or they can be long
and complex programs

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,670
made of many functions.

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,170
But we're not going to look
very much into Shell programming

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,346
in this course.

10
00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:21,719
However, there's
one place that's

11
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,989
very useful to pretty much
everyone who uses the Shell,

12
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:28,059
and that's in customizing
the Shell itself.

13
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:31,079
Here's an example, it's
really common for Shell users

14
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,780
to install programs into
a subdirectory of the home

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,570
directory called Bin,
which stands for binary.

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,640
But the Shell doesn't
come preconfigured to know

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,380
that there are any
commands there.

18
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,597
If you have a program
installed in bin/magic

19
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:45,179
and you want to run
it from the Shell,

20
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,637
you'd have to type the directory
out as well as the command

21
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:48,519
name.

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,939
Now, you can get around that
by adding that directory

23
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:51,854
to your path variable.

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,149
But that gets reset every
time you start a new Shell.

25
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:00,949
In order to make
that change sticky,

26
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,230
you have to put it into the
Shells configuration file.

27
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,656
Now for historical
reasons, there

28
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:07,280
are a few different
files that the Bash

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,400
Shell can run on startup
to get its configuration.

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,900
On a Mac or on a Windows
system with Git Bash,

31
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,640
the Shell in every terminal
you open will run the commands

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,299
in a file called .bash_profile.

33
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:23,209
But on a Linux system,
.bash_profile is only run

34
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:25,939
for some Shell sessions,
specifically log-in Shell

35
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:26,859
sessions.

36
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:31,159
Non-log-in Shells run a
file called .bashrc instead.

37
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,981
Now, this inconsistency
can be a problem

38
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:34,939
if you want to use the
same Shell configuration

39
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,659
on different operating systems.

40
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:40,030
One popular way to get around
this is to put a statement

41
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,930
into your .bash_profile that
says if there is a file called

42
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,330
.bash_rc, run that file.

43
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,670
But if you're only
on Mac or Windows,

44
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,159
you can just use the
.bash_profile without worrying

45
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,390
about that.

46
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,549
Any command you put in
this configuration file

47
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,129
will be run every time
you start the Shell.

48
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:58,689
That includes
variable assignments,

49
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:01,030
like changing dollar sign path.

50
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,469
It can also include
anything you'd

51
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:04,810
like to see at the start
of your Shell session.

52
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,359
Maybe you want to see the
date and a friendly message.

53
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,699
No problem, just put
the date command there.

54
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,820
And maybe something
like echo, hey there.

55
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,819
Then when you start a new Shell,
the commands you put there get

56
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,370
run.
