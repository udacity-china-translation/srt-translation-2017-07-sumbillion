00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
When you look through your files in a graphical interface,

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,145
such as the Macintosh finder,

3
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:06,985
or the Windows file explorer,

4
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:09,570
a folder window shows you the files in

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,465
subdirectories in a particular folder or directory.

6
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:17,485
Like, here's the downloads directory in this computer for the downloads folder.

7
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:20,340
Directory in a folder are basically the same thing.

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,015
But in the shell, we'll use the word directory.

9
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:26,290
To list the contents of a directory in the shell,

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,682
we can use the command LS.

11
00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:32,555
LS is a super shortened version of the word list.

12
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:34,270
When you start the shell,

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,130
it usually starts out looking at your home directory.

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,330
If you just run LS by itself,

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,780
it will print the contents of the current directory.

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,920
To list another directory, say,

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,250
Downloads, you can type LS followed by the name of that directory.

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,075
You can also change what directory the shell is looking at.

19
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,095
The command for this is CD,

20
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:58,170
which stands for Change Directory.

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,690
After you CD into a particular directory,

22
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,860
LS by itself will show the contents of that directory.

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,295
That's something you'll see a lot.

24
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:11,280
Many shell commands default to interacting with the current directory.

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,110
If you want to go back a directory,

26
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,100
you can do that with the special directory name dot dot,

27
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,080
which is also called the Parent Directory and

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,380
the semi-colon lets you write two commands on the same line.

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,000
The shell will just run them in order.
