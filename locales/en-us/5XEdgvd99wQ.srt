1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,143
So once you have a good
understanding of the problem,

2
00:00:03,143 --> 00:00:04,851
you move to the define stage.

3
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:06,662
Could you tell us
a little bit about that?

4
00:00:06,662 --> 00:00:08,787
>> Yeah, I love the define stage.

5
00:00:08,787 --> 00:00:14,255
So we started not by rushing to
solutions, but by understanding.

6
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:18,689
Second, we move to something that
would be absolutely amazing and

7
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:22,260
favorite for
everyone who likes analysis.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,470
The define stage is about
finding a strategy and

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,620
analyzing what is the best path to
actually arrive at the solution.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,295
During this stage, all of the exercises
that someone is familiar with

11
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:36,361
around product strategy become very,
very applicable.

12
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:38,183
Let's list a few examples.

13
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:42,279
The define stage can be greatly enhanced
if people pause to describe the user

14
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:46,000
journey that they're working
to create for the user.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,400
A user journey is a storyboard that
helps define the major pieces,

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,240
step by step, of someone experiencing
the product for the very first time

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,500
when they don't know anything about it,
towards the time when they become

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,750
a masterful user and they're maybe
even evangelizing it to their friends.

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,480
>> So I actually need to write
what the user name is and

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,330
what do they do with the app?

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,959
>> Well, that's a great question.

22
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:14,580
You might not need to have a user
name for the user journey.

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,230
What you're trying to find
is what is the most common

24
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,710
path that someone will take.

25
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,992
From a perspective of
not knowing anything,

26
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:23,460
towards being able to use it over and
over again.

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,680
Now within that,
there may be other stories.

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,140
For example, if you're working on an app
that's reviewing local restaurants,

29
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,580
there may be one journey for
people who are writing the reviews, and

30
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,380
another journey for
people who are reading the reviews.

31
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,830
From those two, the most common path
would be someone hearing about your app.

32
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,020
Hey, there's this great local app,
this can be in a newspaper,

33
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,990
this can be in a restaurant, and
you need to plan for that, because

34
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,270
if you don't plan for the discover
moment, it's just not going to happen.

35
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,090
So you look at it as how
are people discovering my app?

36
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,880
After that, it's about how
are they starting to use it?

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,920
Well, that may mean that they
download it, and then afterwards,

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,060
they're starting to search for
restaurants, read about them, and

39
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,610
then they get reminded after
they've been somewhere potentially,

40
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,710
that they need to write a review.

41
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,080
So let's say the most common path.

42
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,270
The user journey has many
names in the industry.

43
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,479
Because design is a relatively
new discipline in technology,

44
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,212
there have been many different
ways to refer to that.

45
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:24,820
Some people refer to the user
journey as a storyboard.

46
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,070
In fact, what we know from
design history is that Disney

47
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,590
was the first person to use storyboards.

48
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,810
Disney had a team of artists and
technologists who had

49
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,175
to make the first animated movies
before anyone knew how to make that.

50
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:41,165
So in order to keep everybody
on the same page, and

51
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:44,155
not to waste money,
he created the storyboard that said,

52
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:47,245
moment after moment,
what is happening to his characters.

53
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:50,925
And that first storyboard, which was
about the movie Snow White, helped

54
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:55,535
organize his team, and set a precedent
that teams continue to use today.

55
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:58,859
So if you're using a storyboard,
you have Disney to thank for that.

56
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,160
>> And a quick follow-up on that, so how
do I know that I have enough stories,

57
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,440
that I've completed all the stories.

58
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,640
>> So this is a great question.

59
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,003
The user journey is the idea that
there's one central story that is

60
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,092
the most important.

61
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:16,125
Another name for
that is the Golden Path.

62
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,650
That actually comes from Microsoft.

63
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,329
In Microsoft, or so the story goes,
the teams refer to the golden path as

64
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,396
the experience that is absolutely
key for the product to work,

65
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:30,258
for the users to come and
get what they want.

66
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:33,290
The Golden Path is
supported by red threads.

67
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,340
These are the little stories that help
make it possible, and there can be many,

68
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,647
many little thread such as the user sign
in, potentially the shopping experience.

69
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:46,746
But if the Golden Path is your discovery
process then that's what needs to be

70
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:52,175
really easy, really key and all efforts
in the company need to be focused there.

71
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:58,700
So why is it important to be clear
of one most important user journey?

72
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,107
Well, we believe that it is
important to prioritize, and

73
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:06,138
if you don't know what your app is
going to be most commonly used for,

74
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:10,264
then it's really difficult to know
how all the other things fall out.

75
00:04:10,264 --> 00:04:14,016
So, we recommend to always focus
on one central user journey, and

76
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:18,600
to make sure that it is easy and
effortless for people to achieve that.

77
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,579
It's important to plan for everything.

78
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,510
We see a lot of startups fail because
they have created a great product but

79
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,320
they don't have any plan for
how they're going to be discovered.

80
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,300
In that way, they're building
little islands in the ocean, and

81
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,440
there's no line there that will
ever take passengers there.

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,942
This is why we remind people,
plan the entire journey.

83
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:40,541
Plan your product in all of the
different stages, from the time when no

84
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,210
one knows about it, towards the time
when they're really masterful.
