1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,890
The home screen of a website or

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,080
the loading screen of your mobile app,
will be the first impression for users.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,047
And you want to make sure
that you get this right.

4
00:00:08,047 --> 00:00:11,653
Here's Udacity's homepage
as of April 2015.

5
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:15,890
A clear goal headlines the page, and
there's plenty of white space around

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,905
the headlines, and
the tagline to draw users into them.

7
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:22,920
Homepages like this one should
answer these questions.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,040
What is this?

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,340
What is being offered?

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,590
What can I do here?

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,150
And how do I start?

12
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,150
In Udacity's case, the how can I get
started comes just below the fold

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,890
with a description of
the Nanodegree program.

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,380
You want all of this
information to be present, but

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,340
you should also be careful
not to overwhelm your users.

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,330
You want users to have a clear
understanding of what you offer, and

17
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,760
then you can link to other pages for

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,550
users to learn more about
your product or services.

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,060
Many companies put those
links in the footer.

20
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,700
Going back up to the top of
the homepage, we can see that from here,

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,230
I could sign up for an account, or
I could sign in if I'm an existing user.

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,840
To learn more about how
nanodegrees work in particular

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,156
I could click on one of these.

24
00:01:02,156 --> 00:01:05,300
Homepages are tricky in
that they need to do a lot.

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,480
But you want to be careful about
adding more and more to that page so

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,490
sometimes you might have a landing page,
like this one.

27
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,470
Landing pages are for specific products
that you want to show to your users.

28
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,510
They allow you to focus on
one particular product.

29
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,550
Notice that here,
there's a clear call to action.

30
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,840
I can get a sense about what this
product is from the copy on the page and

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,080
also from this background image.

32
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,770
Scrolling down, I can even get
more details about the program.

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,220
To learn more about
designing homepages and

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,220
landing pages, check out the articles
that are linked in the Instructor Notes.

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,700
At the very least, you need to
strive for an informative page, and

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,470
at the best,
your homepage should be memorable.

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,610
It's important to keep in mind that
your homepage doesn't have to be static.

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,610
It should be a work in progress.

39
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,080
Here's another version
of the Udacity homepage.

40
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,700
And notice that it's changed slightly.

41
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,702
We have different copy and these
images have been condensed together.

42
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:02,080
Your homepage might also be dynamic in
that you might be AB testing certain

43
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,060
features of it to see what
drives users actions.

44
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,820
You might also just be trying to refine
your value proposition for your users.

45
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,788
And even before that homepage,

46
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,980
this is what Udacity's homepage
looked like once upon a time.

47
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,870
As you can see,
it's not as informative or

48
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,740
clear at answering the questions,
what is this and what can I do here?

49
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,460
At the end of the day, you want to
make a fantastic first impression.

50
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,250
It's really up to you
to delight users so

51
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,630
that way they come to know who you
are and what you have to offer.

52
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,670
Now it's your turn to do a little
investigation of your own.

53
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,660
I'd like you to find three homepages for
relatively new companies and

54
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,022
analyze them.

55
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:40,418
You want to get a feel for
what type of information and

56
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:42,570
elements live on their homepages.

57
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,220
For each of the homepages you
should ask yourself: what

58
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,250
elements comprise the homepage, what are
the main calls to action, what does that

59
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,250
homepage say about the company,
its users and the value proposition?

60
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,740
And what are the most likely flows

61
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,520
from the homepage to
other places on the site?

62
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,020
In other words,
what could you do from the homepage?

63
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,410
Finally, what are some
of the similarities and

64
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,160
differences you see across
the homepages you looked at?

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,240
Write a post that answers
these questions and

66
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,950
share it on the discussions.

67
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,810
