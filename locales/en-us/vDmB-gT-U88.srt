00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Remember that a polyfill is used to fill a hole

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,690
in a browser that doesn't yet support the native feature.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,935
This polyfill start to check to see if the native startsWith method actually exists.

4
00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:14,429
Why? Because if it does exist then

5
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,530
we don't want to override the native version with this one.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,275
So if it doesn't exist,

7
00:00:19,274 --> 00:00:23,754
then the browser running this polyfill will then run all of this code.

8
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:27,649
This adds a new method to Strings.prototype object.

9
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:30,479
The function defaults to the position indicated by

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,424
the second argument that's passed in or it'll be the first character of the string.

11
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:38,214
Then it just returns true or false.

12
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:42,780
If the string that's passed in is the same as the string that we're looking at.
