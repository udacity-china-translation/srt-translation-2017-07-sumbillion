00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,530
Now we know how to get files from off the web.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,040
But what can we do with them once we have them?

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,340
Well, there's a shell command called cat

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,250
that just reads the file and outputs the contents.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,290
Actually, it can read any number of files.

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,465
The name cat is short for Catenate

7
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:19,725
or Concatenate which means to run several things together.

8
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:23,590
So let's try that. Cat dictionary.txt.

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,945
Went straight to zucchinis and zwieback and zygote.

10
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,685
That's not very useful if we wanted to see the top of the file.

11
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:34,550
It just blasted the file at our terminal so quick that it went right to the end.

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,575
Fortunately, there's another program,

13
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:40,255
less, which shows us less of the file at once.

14
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:44,120
Specifically, it'll just show you one screenful of the file at a time.

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,880
You press space to scroll down or you can use the arrow keys.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,760
It has some other commands like B to go back or slash to search.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,080
When you're done in less,

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,160
you can press Q to quit.

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,860
And less is really handy.

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,680
It's used internally by a lot of other programs that might

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,330
sometimes need to display a lot of output and give you a chance to catch up.
