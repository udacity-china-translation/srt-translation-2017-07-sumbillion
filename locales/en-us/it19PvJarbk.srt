1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:04,019
OK, so now maybe we've made a
bunch of files and directories

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,929
and stuff, and we want to clean
them up to delete some things.

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:10,109
Well, the Shell command
for deleting files

4
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:13,279
is rm, which is
short for remove.

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,149
rm works the same
as you'd probably

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,129
expect from other
Shell commands,

7
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:20,399
you just give it the name of the
file, or the names of the files

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,250
that you want to remove.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,199
Now, I've got to give
you a safety warning.

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,939
In your GUI, you've probably
got a trash can or recycle bin

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,009
where files go when you
want to get rid of them,

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,799
but you can take them back
out if you change your mind.

13
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,289
The rm command does
not work like this.

14
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:39,539
It just removes the files.

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,390
If you want a
little more warning,

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,140
maybe you're afraid you
might remove a valuable file

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,549
by mistake, well, you
can use the option -I.

18
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:53,250
The I is for interactive,
which will prompt you

19
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,539
for every file it's
going to remove.

20
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:59,049
Now for directories, there's
a different command, which

21
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:03,097
is rmdir for remove directory.
