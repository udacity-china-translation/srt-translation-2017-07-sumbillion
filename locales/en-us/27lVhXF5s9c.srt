00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,440
One activity that helps people
warm up in the diverge stage

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,890
is the crazy eights.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,390
You give everyone a sheet of paper, and

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,200
you ask them to fold it three times to
create eight different rectangles, then,

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,250
in each rectangle,
you put one idea related to the product.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,640
Now, you only have five
minutes to do this activity.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,150
So you go as quickly as possible,
and you try and

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,040
push yourself to put something
in every single box.

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,350
Now, this activity can be a little
bit intimidating to people who aren't

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,065
as designers.

11
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:29,545
So here are a few tips for
what you can do.

12
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:32,034
First, it's a good idea
to remind yourself and

13
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:34,685
the team about common UI elements.

14
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:39,215
Most UI components are very basic
shapes, like rectangles and circles.

15
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:41,370
And they can be drawn pretty easily.

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,530
You might remind your team of some of
those shapes, like list, and icons, and

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,180
buttons, and titles.

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,130
You might also just spend a few
minutes looking at mobile patterns, so

19
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,840
that way you can check out
what others have done.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,770
You might also download free mobile or
web UI kits.

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,130
So that way you can go through
some of those design components.

22
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,510
Just be sure not to leave these
resources up during an activity,

23
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,050
because the focus should
be on sketching ideas.

24
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,820
All right, now it's your turn.

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,660
Set a timer for five minutes and

26
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,985
sketch eight ideas you have that are
related to the Super Duper Shopping App.

27
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:17,425
Now, keep in mind the activity
that you did with the Golden Path.

28
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:21,295
And remember that main user journey or
that story that you created.

29
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:24,825
