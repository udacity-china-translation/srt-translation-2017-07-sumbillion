1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,290
The first metric of interest
is Net Promoter Score or NPS.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,590
NPS is a customer loyalty metric that is
determined by asking users one question.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,070
On a scale of zero to ten, how likely
are you to recommend this product or

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,890
service to a friend.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,763
Customers who respond with
a number between zero and

6
00:00:19,763 --> 00:00:22,060
six are called your detractors.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,379
Customers who score seven or
eight are your passives, and

8
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,840
anyone ranking with a nine or
ten is a promoter.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,080
And to actually calculate your NPS you
take their percent of promoters and

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,170
then subtract out
the percent of detractors.

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,950
This actually means that NPS can fall
between negative 100 and positive 100.

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,960
You could, for example, have everyone
vote you between zero and six.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,930
A good Net Promoter Score
will vary by industry.

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,360
As you can tell from this chart,
many industries have a wide range for

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,130
net promoter scores.

16
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,100
And you can see their averages in
these squares along the graph.

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,260
If you'd like to take
a closer look at this chart,

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,890
you can refer to it in
the instructor notes.

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,030
Click Through Rate is another metric
that you'll find associated with website

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,550
buttons, links, and e-mail campaigns.

21
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,560
With CTR, you're measuring whether or
not a user took action.

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,630
CTRs are helpful for

23
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,290
determining how customers advance
through steps of a purchase.

24
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,450
For example, one checkout flow
could be on Udacity's website.

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,350
We could collect data on how
many users check out a homepage,

26
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,320
go to a description page for a product,
how many clicked to start a free trial,

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,280
and how many actually completed the
payment information form to register for

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,910
that free trial.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,600
Daily active users, or DAU,
is another common metric, and

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,680
it can take on multiple meanings.

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,040
The trickiest part is defining what
active means for your product.

32
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,380
It could be as simple as logging in,
performing specific tasks, or

33
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,040
making a purchase,
depending on your business.

34
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,380
You can track the number of users
over time, and you'll likely see some

35
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,740
variation from day to day, maybe even
a plateau, and then hopefully you'll see

36
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,600
an uptick where you get a lot
of adoptions from new users.

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,290
By relating product launches,
new features, press releases, and

38
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,860
even market research to this data,
you can get a sense for

39
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,430
what might be driving your traffic.

40
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,670
These next three metrics
are similar to daily active users.

41
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,640
Except you're tracking active users,

42
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,750
in whichever way you define active
over some defined period of time.

43
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,590
So instead of having daily active users,
you might have weekly active users,

44
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,030
or monthly active users.

45
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,230
Here's a bar chart showing monthly
active users for WhatsApp.

46
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,490
WhatsApp is a popular mobile
messaging application.

47
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,230
Now, you might be wondering why
some of these bars are missing, and

48
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,090
it's just because the source of
the data didn't have this information.

49
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,930
It'd probably be better to show this
as a line chart over time, but I

50
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,070
didn't want to give the impression that
these points were actually in the data.

51
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,550
To calculate any x day active users,
you simply total the number of

52
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,330
unique users who initiated
sessions on your website or

53
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,760
mobile application from a starting date
all the way until the ending date.

54
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,260
You might also look at
patterns over weekday or

55
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,540
weekend activity to spot trends.

56
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,060
For example, Twitter determined that if
a user opened Twitter seven times in one

57
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,970
month then the user
was likely to return.

58
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,550
By attracting active users and
possibly what features they use,

59
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,420
you might determine what is
driving users back to the product.

60
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,760
And finally,
another useful metric is retention.

61
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,870
It's the opposite of churn or attrition.

62
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,900
Retention describes the number or

63
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,980
the percent of users you keep
over a certain period of time.

64
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,050
While not counting any new users you
acquired during that same time interval.

65
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,420
Now, this example wouldn't really be
that great, because I'm only keeping,

66
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,520
let's say,
about 1% of my users after 12 weeks.

67
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,390
Even better,
you can monitor cohorts of users

68
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,580
based on when they start
using the product or service.

69
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,580
For example, you can create retention
curves for two groups of users.

70
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,300
Let's say one group of users
starts on January 1st,

71
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,020
while the other starts on January 8th.

72
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,920
To learn more about cohort analysis,
check out this article

73
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,550
on Nir Ariel's blog,
which is linked in the instructor notes.

74
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,470
The article discusses how to measure
retention and use cohort analysis,

75
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,770
while looking at user retention for
Pinterest and Twitter.

76
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,510
Now, these are some of
the common baseline metrics.

77
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,709
And whatever metric you choose,
the metric needs to signal

78
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,540
that users are using
the product in an expected way,

79
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,060
and that the same users are likely to
come back and use the product more.

80
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,920
This certainly isn't every
metric that you might want, but

81
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,140
these are some common ones that
you'll use in most products.

82
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,090
In the next video,
we'll look at a framework for

83
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,770
how you can come up with other metrics.
