00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,294
Welcome back. In this lesson,

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:05,009
we're gonna cover updates to functions in the ES6.

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,378
Functions have changed a lot since the last version of JavaScript.

4
00:00:08,378 --> 00:00:11,309
We've now got a new way to write functions called arrow functions,

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,257
and a new class keyword that lets you create functions as classes.

6
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:17,475
That's not all. In ES6,

7
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,935
you can now set up default function parameters.

8
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:22,109
Plus, you can connect different classes

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,259
together using the new "super" and "extends" keywords.

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,470
Yeah, there have been a lot of new changes.

11
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:30,809
Well, we better get started before any more changes are added.

12
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:32,429
Wait, what, more changes?

13
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,519
The first thing we'll look at is arrow functions.
