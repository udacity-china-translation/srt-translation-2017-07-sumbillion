00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,290
The last thing that I want to cover is
that you make sure that you get feedback

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,670
from users every step of the way.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,580
Feedback takes a lot of different forms,
and you've already seen how

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,830
you can conduct user research
to inform your business idea.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,960
You might try incorporating
a survey into your product.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,140
You could send these out each week or
month to collect feedback, or

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,280
you might even try and embed them
in some way into your product.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,040
Social media is another great way to
monitor early usage of your product, and

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,280
have customers connect to your brand.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,820
App ratings, or user ratings, or website
ratings, are another way to understand

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,340
quantitatively, and qualitatively
what users think of your product.

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,330
One app, which is called Circa News
provides the following guidance on

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,180
ratings.

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,300
First, they recommend that you
just build a great product.

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,520
If you don't build a great product,

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,210
users aren't going to give you
good ratings in the first place.

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,450
Secondly, don't annoy the users.

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,630
You should really only ask them to rate
your product if they've had a good

19
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,790
experience and they've used
the product for a little bit.

20
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,810
And finally, Circa News recommends
that you ask nicely, and

21
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,310
maybe even reward your users for
rating the app.

22
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,930
For more details about their advice,
check out the article,

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,120
which is linked in the instructor notes.

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,970
Finally, you should make
customer support everyone's job.

25
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,720
You might have a dedicated email or

26
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,720
chat service that lets users
talk directly to employees.

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,850
Former CCO, and co-founder of Kayak,
Paul English, went so

28
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,050
far as putting the very loud phone
in the middle of the engineers.

29
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,620
He reasoned that if the same
calls kept coming in,

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,590
then the team would work quickly
to resolve the problems.

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,230
This would likely resolve the same
problems that other users were facing.

32
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,760
No matter which strategy you use,
you should think about

33
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,800
when you'll intercept users and
how you will respond to them.

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,530
Your actions and

35
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,150
improvements to your product can speak
just as loudly as individual follow ups.

36
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,950
But do remember that these
experiences also contribute

37
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,710
to the user's experience and
their perception of the product.
