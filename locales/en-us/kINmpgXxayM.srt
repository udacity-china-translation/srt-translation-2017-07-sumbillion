00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,330
One more cool little trick
for customizing the shell--

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,160
this one is called aliases.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,195
It's a way of making long shell
commands shorter, because what

4
00:00:08,195 --> 00:00:10,320
you really needed in the
shell was for the commands

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,030
to be even shorter, right?

6
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:13,529
So the way aliases
work is that you

7
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:17,939
use the alias command to give
a short name, such as "ll,"

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,510
to a longer command,
such as "ls -la."

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,260
It's just like this--

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,280
alias ll, equal sign, single
quote, ls space hyphen la,

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,660
single quote.

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,450
Now just as when you're
assigning variables,

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,946
the alias command doesn't
want to see a bunch of spaces

14
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:37,320
on either side of
the equal sign.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,509
That will just give you
a bunch of weird errors.

16
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:40,859
Don't do that.

17
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:42,960
After you create an
alias, any time you

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,039
type the short command,
like ll, the shell

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,929
will just run the
long command, ls -la.

20
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:54,200
If you want to list all of
the aliases that you have,

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,444
just run the alias
command with no arguments.

22
00:00:57,444 --> 00:00:59,109
Now one of the cool
things about aliases

23
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:02,359
is that you can use them the
same as regular commands.

24
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,780
You can do ls on a
directory, and you can

25
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,280
do ll on a directory as well.

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,989
Any options you
put after the alias

27
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:13,599
when you use it will just go
on the end of the command.

28
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:21,399
So ll/user/bin gets turned
into ls -la/user/bin.

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,490
Now this ll command will only
last as long as this terminal

30
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:25,745
window is open.

31
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:28,119
If you want your aliases to
be there every time you start

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,250
your shell, well, you put
them in your .bash_profile.

33
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,150
Here are some examples
of popular aliases

34
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,612
that I found looking around
at what other people use.

35
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:38,319
This last one, I think,
is pretty clever,

36
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,469
because sometimes people
typo "sl" instead of "ls,"

37
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,730
and this one just automatically
corrects it for them.
