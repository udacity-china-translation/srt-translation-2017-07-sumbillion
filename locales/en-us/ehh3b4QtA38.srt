00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,840
In one sentence,
how would you describe a design sprint?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,140
>> In sprints,
you either win or you learn.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,190
You win when you get to solve
your project quickly and

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,830
you get to launch and
have customers love your work and

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,060
you learn if you achieve anything but
that.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,850
When your customers
don't like your project,

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,510
you're learning about it quickly.

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,910
And if there's problems with your
solution that would prevent your team

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,190
from being able to execute it or
they don't serve the business cause,

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,580
you get to learn within two to
five days and that is saving time.
