Arrow functions are awesome and can really clean up your code by

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,599
removing a lot of the unnecessary things like the function keyword,

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,259
the return keyword, and curly braces.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,519
Get those things out of here.

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:13,259
Yeah. Who needs those things? But don't just go

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,376
converting all of your regular functions in the arrow functions just yet,

7
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:18,734
because there's a big gotcha with the arrow functions.

8
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:23,100
The way arrow functions handle "this" keyword is different from regular functions.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,640
Wow. Yeah, I mean that's kind of important to know about.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,679
A bit more than kind of important.

11
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,570
In fact, the next section is all about

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,000
arrow functions and "this" keyword. Go check it out.
