1
00:00:00,809 --> 00:00:03,084
>> First, you want to
understand the business goals.

2
00:00:03,084 --> 00:00:07,035
If you're not making money, if you're
not responding to where the business

3
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:10,316
needs to grow and to the culture
that the business is promoting,

4
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:12,463
then the solution might
be the wrong one.

5
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:15,307
Second, you want to
understand engineering.

6
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:18,407
The technologies,
which makes the ideas come to life.

7
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:21,053
So without understanding
where the technology's at and

8
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:24,840
what the team is able to deliver,
it kind of doesn't matter.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,580
That's it.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,160
So we covered the business perspective
and then we covered the technology.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,095
What's missing?

12
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:33,337
What do you think is
the third perspective?

13
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:34,253
>> The users?

14
00:00:34,253 --> 00:00:35,356
>> That's right.

15
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:40,501
If there's something that's important in
design solution, it is who it is for.

16
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:45,418
The designers and the whole team need to
understand who are the potential users

17
00:00:45,418 --> 00:00:47,068
and what are their needs?

18
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:50,855
When you circle problem in this
manner and you look at it from all

19
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:55,430
perspectives, business, technology,
design, you're creating a more

20
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,870
holistic approach, so that the solutions
that come have wisdom to them.

21
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,727
That they're not rushed,
that they're better targeted.

22
00:01:02,727 --> 00:01:06,627
>> And what would you say is the most
important thing in this stage?

23
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:10,587
>> I think in this stage, it's important
to hear different perspectives.

24
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:13,581
If you are over focusing on one and
not the other,

25
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:16,367
you might have a solution
that's lopsided.

26
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:20,599
So in sprint, we try to be balanced in
the beginning and hear from everyone

27
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:25,331
who'll be involved in making the product
or who'll be involved in approving it.

28
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:27,411
If you're in a large company,

29
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:32,298
this may be the director of the product
and the director of engineering.

30
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:34,838
They represent the business and
the technology.

31
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:39,134
Similarly, the user researchers or
the marketing and sales teams.

32
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:40,838
Now, if you're in a startup,

33
00:01:40,838 --> 00:01:44,651
you might not have a person
representing every single perspective.

34
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:46,773
>> You could be the single person
who represents everything.

35
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,899
>> You could be the three things, right?

36
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,457
>> Right.

37
00:01:48,457 --> 00:01:51,208
>> In a startup, you often
are wearing all these different hats.

38
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,855
So, it's useful to consider and pause.

39
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:55,529
Even if you're one person or

40
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:59,576
even if you are small team that
doesn't have diversified roles yet,

41
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:03,204
what are the perspectives on this
problem as looking in it from

42
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:07,910
a business perspective, there's one
set of issues that they're important.

43
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,627
Those are about the metrics,
the goals, the revenue.

44
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:12,702
Looking in from
a technology perspective,

45
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:14,389
there's another set of problems.

46
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:17,408
That is generally,
what is the code able to do?

47
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:19,705
What are the features
that are being developed?

48
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:23,561
What's available to outsource or
what APIs are available to bring in?

49
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,489
And then from a design perspective,

50
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:28,668
it's about what are the user
needs that you want to address?

51
00:02:28,668 --> 00:02:31,000
When you look at it from
these three perspectives,

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,485
even if you have a small team, you're
helping people stretch their minds.

53
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:38,036
They're really opening up, so
that they can consider and

54
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:39,709
not miss out on a good idea.

55
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:42,785
>> Right and
what could go wrong in this stage?

56
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:44,701
>> Oh, that's a great question.

57
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:48,800
Often, I see teams take a very
long time in this stage.

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,962
If the team doesn't know each other
well, this may be a rare opportunity for

59
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:57,125
them to start talking to each other and
they're so excited to learn from each

60
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,397
other that the stage can drag on and
take two or three hours.

61
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:04,062
The goal of the sprint is to understand,
but then quickly move towards the other

62
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:07,579
stages in which people are defining
a strategy and starting to make things.

63
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:11,515
So what could go wrong is the team
can spend too long in this stage.

64
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:14,968
>> So they could be circling
around until they understand and

65
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:17,018
never to get to an understanding.

66
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:21,615
>> What could go wrong is they
could be like really circling.

67
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:25,795
Another thing that could go wrong,
which is actually a chance for

68
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:31,450
something to go right is that the
challenge might be improperly defined.

69
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,876
Sometimes people who are beginners
in the art of being a sprint master,

70
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:38,839
approach the challenge
in a very specific way.

71
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:41,997
And when they offer to the team,
they learn that actually the team has

72
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:45,654
a different need and there's something
else that's more important to solve.

73
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:48,393
That is a mistake that's easier
to correct in the beginning

74
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,378
of this program and
not during this phase.

75
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:54,764
But if a sprint leader finds themself
confronted with a team that says,

76
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:57,104
we should be solving something else,

77
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,120
it is a great opportunity
to seek to understand.

78
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,997
Open your ears and help your team agree
on what is the right thing to do,

79
00:04:03,997 --> 00:04:04,600
quickly.

80
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,238
>> Very cool.

81
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:09,570
So what I hear from you is that
the basic of these stages to understand.

82
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,048
To understand the business,
to understand the technology and

83
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:13,133
to understand your users.

84
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:13,690
>> That's right.
