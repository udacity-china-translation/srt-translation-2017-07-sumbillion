1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,419
So with all
of this CDing around,

2
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:08,118
it's possible to
get kind of lost.

3
00:00:08,118 --> 00:00:10,279
Depending on your
system, the shell prompt

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:13,589
might or might not tell you
what directory you're in,

5
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,289
but there is a command
that will always tell you,

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,629
the pwd command.


7
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:21,989
That stands for Print
Working Directory.

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,049
The working directory is another
word for whatever directory

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,179
the shell is
currently looking at.

10
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,269
It's the default directory
for commands like ls.

11
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,219
And it's the default
place that shell commands

12
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,109
will look for data files.


13
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:35,909
You'll notice that the
names of directories

14
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,309
are separated by slashes.


15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,640
The Unix system uses the forward
slash, not the backslash,

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,770
to separate the
names of directories.

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,280
Forward slash is the same one
you've seen in URLs on the web.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,550
This whole string, composed
of several directory

19
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:54,939
names separated by
slashes, is called a path.

20
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:57,619
There are a few special
directory names.

21
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:00,349
You've seen dot,
dot before, it means

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,000
the parent directory,
the directory

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,189
that this directory is inside.


24
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,569
There's also dot, just
means the current directory.

25
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:12,049
ls dot is just the same as ls.


26
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,230
And the shell also has a
shortcut, the tilde, which

27
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,900
stands for my home directory.


28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,140
Like regardless of what
directory your CD'd into,

29
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,849
ls tilde will list
your home directory.
