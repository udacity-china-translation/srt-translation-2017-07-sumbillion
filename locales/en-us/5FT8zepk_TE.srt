1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,530
Payment forms are another type of form
that you'll likely use in your product.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,620
You'll want to keep these simple and
easy to use, so

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,150
that way the user can focus
on purchasing the product.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,110
You'll also want to provide
different payment options.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,600
This form looks a little long, but

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,350
at least there are different options for
payment.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,940
Gumroad is a startup that
does this really well.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,260
Gumroad connects sellers of
digital products to buyers.

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,350
You could sell or
buy a variety of things in Gumroad.

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,060
Let's say I wanted to buy
a music management book.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,210
I could click on I want this, and I get
redirected to the simplest payment form.

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,430
However, don't mistake simplicity for
lack of design.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,010
The devil is in the details with
this form, and there are so

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,650
many great details.

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,860
The price for
the item is clearly displayed here.

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,030
Input place holders describe
what each field should contain.

17
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,130
And even on the credit card,

18
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,400
we can see that the format hints at
the spacing groups of four numbers.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,180
I also need to enter a two digit month,
a two digit year, and a CB code.

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,450
When I start typing in
my payment information,

21
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,430
the form selects the credit
card that I'm using.

22
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,620
Don't worry, this isn't my credit card.

23
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,660
Many credit card companies
have reserved prefixes.

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,530
Eventually I'll have to enter
at CVV code as well, and

25
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,440
this form tells me where to find it.

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,600
For Visa its on the back
of the credit card.

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,370
For other credit cards,
such as American Express,

28
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,200
we can see that the CV code is
on the front of the credit card.

29
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,140
Now, the one thing missing from this
form, is some indication of trust.

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,640
There's a lock down here, but
I don't really know what this means.

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,530
Another website, called UXPin,
reminds users about security and

32
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,690
encryption on their payment form.

33
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,330
Some other sites use logos like these
to remind users about secure payment

34
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,400
methods.

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,640
These types of details
increase conversions and

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,990
make for great user experiences.

37
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,600
They can make your users love not only
your product, but also how they buy it.
