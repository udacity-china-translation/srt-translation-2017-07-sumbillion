1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,770
The sprint is something
that you need to design and

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,980
it's the job of the sprint master or
you in this case, to plan the activities

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,490
that you're going to do before,
during and after the sprint.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,210
Let me give you an idea of what you
can expect in each of these periods.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,550
First, you should know that you're
going to do a lot of work up front.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,269
In general, you want to spend
about one day of planning for

7
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:21,750
each day of the design sprint.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,050
Now this will feel like a lot
of work and it should be.

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,210
The good news is that good planning will
help you run a smooth design sprint and

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,710
let you solve your design
challenge quickly.

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,960
Before the design sprint,
you'll want to write a design brief.

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,345
This will let you define
your design challenge and

13
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:41,918
then it will also let you set a timeline
for when you want to launch or when you

14
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:46,220
want this deliverable, whatever it is
in the design sprint to be reviewed.

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,052
Before the sprint, you'll also
want to invite team members or

16
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:50,090
talent to the sprint.

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,459
Nadia will talk more
about this later and

18
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:55,670
one of the key parts of a design
sprint is user testing.

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,772
You need to schedule when users will
take a look at whatever you design from

20
00:00:58,772 --> 00:00:59,630
the design sprint.

21
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,189
The user testing will keep you
accountable, validate product ideas and

22
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:06,339
push you and perhaps your team
toward showing users something by

23
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:08,380
the end of the design sprint.

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,040
Now this might now make a whole
lot of sense right now,

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,060
but I guarantee you it will
by the end of this lesson.

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,990
Finally, before the sprint, you'll also
want to schedule any lightning talks

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,820
more on this later and
you want to prep the slide deck

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,570
that you'll use in the sprint and
leave room for special materials.

29
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,895
In the next video, I'll cover
the details of a design brief and

30
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:30,920
how you can appropriately
scope your design challenge.

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,800
Here are the tasks that you'll
need to do during a design sprint.

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,781
If you're working alone,
you won't need to do daily check ins and

33
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:40,137
daily summaries, instead you should
keep a master list of all the tasks you

34
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:43,480
need to get done, so
that way you can stay organized.

35
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,590
You should also write reflections after
each day, so you can look back on them

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,340
and get better at planning and designing
the sprints alone or with a team.

37
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,350
One of the hardest parts about
conducting a design sprint

38
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,340
is facilitating conversation and

39
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,460
resolving conflict among your
teammates should they arise.

40
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,940
Now you won't really need to worry
about this if you're working alone, but

41
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,120
you will need to be the point person or

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,258
appoint someone else to resolve
any conflicts when they do arise.

43
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:13,930
After the design sprint, you should take
the lead to summarize the results and

44
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,000
plan next steps.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,843
If you worked with a team, you'll want
to send out a short survey to ask your

46
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:22,880
teammates about how the design sprint
went and what could go better next time.

47
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,011
If you're working solo, then you should
just reflect on what happened and

48
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,560
how you might improve in the future.

49
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,220
And hopefully,

50
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,420
you're already working towards
planning your next design sprint.

51
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,210
All of this should feel like
a lot of work and well, it is.

52
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,938
Thankfully, many other companies
have done design sprints before and

53
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:43,859
there's tons of great resources and
documentation and

54
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:46,670
short articles about how
to conduct design sprints.

55
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,078
Global Ventures, for example,

56
00:02:48,078 --> 00:02:51,270
has put together this awesome
list of resources for you.

57
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,497
They also have a great collection,
a library of resources that has short

58
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:59,794
articles that will walk you through all
of the steps needed to schedule and

59
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:01,960
conduct user research interviews.

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,488
These are also the your
usability testing interviews

61
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:06,630
that you'll do at the end
of a design sprint.

62
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,599
All of these resources will be included
in a reading node at the end of this

63
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,130
lesson.

64
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,380
They also have a great library
of additional resources.

65
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,819
In this library, you'll find
a collection of short articles that will

66
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,604
walk you through all the steps needed to
schedule and conduct user research and

67
00:03:21,604 --> 00:03:25,503
usability interviews, The links to these
articles will be provided in a reading

68
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:27,020
node at the end of this lesson.
