00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,600
In the upcoming videos,
I'll be sharing user experiences and

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,810
talking about design decisions that
can influence your product and

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,210
your users' behaviors with the product.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,960
We'll examine some of the best and worst
examples of user experience, so you can

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,590
focus on the most important parts for
the development of your product.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,730
The goal of this is to expose
you to design considerations, so

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,830
you can address the biggest concerns
in the early stages of the product.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,150
At the end of this lesson, you'll be
equipped with ideas and resources for

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,800
conducting design sprints and
working with designers.
