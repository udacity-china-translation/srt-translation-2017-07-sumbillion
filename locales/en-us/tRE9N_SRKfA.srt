1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,340
So now that we have a prototype, we're
moving to the validation stage, right?

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,400
>> That's right.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,380
The validation stage answers
the hardest question in product design.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,280
The hardest question
in product design is

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,640
how do you know if
your work is any good?

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,075
>> Okay, that's an important question.

7
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:19,470
>> [LAUGH] It's very important.

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,850
How we answer this question
has three different stages.

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:29,110
At Google we use something that
we call triple validation.

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,320
Just like in the beginning we looked
at a problem from the perspective of

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,390
business, technology,
and users, at the end

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,270
we want to validate the solution
from the same three touch points.

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,260
The most important opinion, and
the most important votes and

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,480
validation, is that of the users.

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,880
So the critical piece not to
miss is the opportunity to

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,830
test your prototype with your users.

17
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,190
We recommend sprinters and the sprint
lead recruit users from the very

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,310
beginning of the sprint, so they know
that, at the end, the users are coming.

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,480
>> Right.

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,390
>> And they have to prepare for it, and

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,720
else, all the efforts that they have
spent in prototyping could go to waste

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,030
because they don't actually know if this
is solving the needs the users have.

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,120
So meeting the users at the beginning
is useful to learn their needs, and

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,490
meeting them at the end is
crucial in order to test.

25
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,780
This type of test is called usability
test or Cognitive Walkthrough.

26
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,490
It allows you to put the products or
the early prototype in

27
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,650
the hands of a user and watch them
walkthrough all the different stages.

28
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,890
What do they like?

29
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,410
Where do they get stuck?

30
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,390
Do they understand
what the idea is about?

31
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,880
And it's important that they have and
they expressed earlier on.

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,290
>> Do I need to explain to
the user what he needs to do?

33
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,230
>> What we like to do in this stage
is kind of like it's based on one of

34
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,875
the ideas of writing, show, don't tell.

35
00:01:55,875 --> 00:02:00,075
A great design prototype should
be able to stand on its own

36
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:02,045
without too much explaining.

37
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:05,845
Generally we'd like to set up the user
and say, imagine you're shopping for

38
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:09,074
a new product, or imagine you're
looking to write the review, and

39
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:12,333
now tell me what you see, and
now tell me what you're doing from here.

40
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:17,150
So we ask the users questions, and
ask them to imagine themselves

41
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,340
solving a specific scenario,
and we watch what they do.

42
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,690
We ask them questions to clarify, but

43
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,630
we're not trying to sell
the product to them.

44
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,100
One of the mistakes that
people make in this stage

45
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,880
is that they imagine this
is a marketing pitch and

46
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,508
they start explaining how awesome the
product is, or why they love the idea.

47
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:41,810
This is a useful approach if you're
trying to recruit that specific person

48
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,400
to buy your product and they might,
just because they're trying to be nice.

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,760
But this approach does not
answer the critical question,

50
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,420
is the product any good?

51
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,700
Like you force someone in person to
buy something is very different from

52
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,910
creating something that's popular,
and that works on its own.

53
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,640
>> That people love.

54
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,249
>> That's right [LAUGH].

55
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:05,370
>> And are users the only people I
want to get in front of this prototype?

56
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,760
>> Well, the user validation is
one of three points in the rapid

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,340
evaluation process.

58
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,640
The other two points involve
the business and the technology.

59
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,880
It's really useful to test with
the stakeholders of the team.

60
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,410
Is it still meeting the business goals?

61
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,790
Is it still answering the promises
that you made to investors, or

62
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,510
the goals that you have as a company?

63
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,940
And if yes, fantastic, and if no,
we need to go back to the drawing board.

64
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,870
More often than not, teams are aligned
with the business goals and

65
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,900
the stakeholders are happy
with the results.

66
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,140
But if you skip the validation,
they might not approve the design or

67
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,310
block it at a later stage.

68
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,320
So, having your quick check-in with the
stakeholders, even if they didn't attend

69
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,530
the entire sprint,
can be very useful at this stage.

70
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,020
>> Very cool.

71
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,470
>> Another piece that's important
here is doing a technical check.

72
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,040
A design solution that's beautiful but
no one can implement, it's only so

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,910
valuable.

74
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,550
So what we want to do is encourage teams
to check in with a technical staff.

75
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,340
Is this still going the right
direction in terms of feasibility?

76
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,490
And if this seems challenging,
let's clarify it.

77
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,430
What are the pieces here that seems like
they're going to take the longest and

78
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,170
how might we be able to point is
designing a way that's not creating

79
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,570
hurdles, and it's something that
we can test and deliver quickly?

80
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,540
>> Okay, so what I'm hearing is
we need to do three validations,

81
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,260
validate with users,
validate with business stakeholders, and

82
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,240
validate with technology people.

83
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,320
>> Yeah,
these validations can be rather quick.

84
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,670
A user test can be 20 to 30 minutes and
you can test with three or

85
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,090
four or five different people.

86
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,410
For most teams, you can even test with
one person, it's already a success.

87
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,150
The business validation can be
a five to ten minute discussion, or

88
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,190
longer if the issue is very problematic.

89
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,600
Or the technical validation can be
similarly short, five to ten minutes.

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,260
We're doing this as a best practice.

91
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,620
Sort of like covering a checklist to
make sure that all the possible ways in

92
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,140
which something can fail to deliver
after this point are addressed.

93
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,390
And there are also people
vouching to the solution,

94
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,170
which makes it easier
to deliver afterwards.

95
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,260
>> So what could go wrong in this stage?

96
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,740
>> That's a great question.

97
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,530
What could go wrong is that teams can

98
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,320
be overly confident in their own
solution and skip the user testing.

99
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,670
That is a common pattern that we see
with teams that are new to sprinting.

100
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,450
They think, well,
we can do the user testing later.

101
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,710
It is true that the user test can be
done separately from this print, but

102
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,900
that is a miss.

103
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,000
While the team is together and
they're fresh in the space

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,660
of all the prototyping, it is really
valuable to right away get feedback.

105
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,850
If you do the user test with
your whole team present and

106
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,380
right after the creation session, this
gives the need to write any research

107
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,570
documents and it keeps all
the ideas fresh in their minds.

108
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,400
That makes it that much more
likely that the products and

109
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,160
the problems will get
addressed in the next phase.

110
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,395
>> And what happens if they don't like
the solution, if the users hate it?

111
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:00,680
>> [LAUGH] Well,

112
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,720
if the users hate solution it's
a great opportunity to learn.

113
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,600
We try to be humble with our designs.

114
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,020
After all, we only spend two
to five days working on them.

115
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,870
We hope that the life of the company
will be much longer than that, so

116
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,060
those two to five days were
valuable if you learn something.

117
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,120
So if the users don't like something,

118
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,730
it's a great time to
seek to understand again.

119
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,910
So we go back to the first way of
thinking, which was let's understand.

120
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,940
What is it that they don't like,

121
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,700
is there something that
could be solved better?

122
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,140
Asking questions and

123
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,070
probing deeper into the things that
users don't like is great opportunity.

124
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,250
The best time to learn if
the users don't like something

125
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,590
is right after you have created
the prototype, into the five days.

126
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,750
And not after you spend two years of
your life telling everyone you love and

127
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,330
maxing out your credit card
[LAUGH] this is a great idea.

128
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,070
>> So in this stage,

129
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,360
we take the users, we let them play with
the prototype, and we listen to them.

130
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,860
>> That's right.
