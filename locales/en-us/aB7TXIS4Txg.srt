1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,210
And what are some good examples
of accessible products?

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,300
>> So one example I like to
share are Google Docs and Drive.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,960
I feel like they've come a long
way over the past year and a half.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,460
>> Yeah.
And

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,040
what sorts do you feel like
they've done really, really well?

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,830
>> Well, as you can see here
on the Google Docs app,

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,600
there's a lot of good things
that they have considered.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,956
One is good contrast between
the text and the background colors.

9
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:31,335
They allow,
they support large fonts really well.

10
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:35,225
So that when you do enlarge the fonts
on here that essential items or

11
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:39,647
elements aren't getting cut off, either
able to zoom in where you need to.

12
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:43,037
And they also have really have
good screen leaders support.

13
00:00:43,037 --> 00:00:47,097
Screen leaders are interesting
assisted technologies to design for.

14
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:52,057
There's a lot to consider,
because they not only read the content,

15
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:54,897
like the words that are on the screen,
but they also, read and

16
00:00:54,897 --> 00:00:58,027
announce the different elements that
are on the screen such as buttons and

17
00:00:58,027 --> 00:00:59,037
links and menus.

18
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:06,070
And some of the aspects of a good
experience with a screen reader and

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,330
things you need to take
into consideration are one,

20
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,270
ensuring that the way the user
goes through the page and

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,040
the screen that the elements
are in a logical order.

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,270
So it kind of goes left to right,
top down,

23
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,250
if that's how the elements
are laid out on the screen.

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:31,430
And but another key thing that is really
important is what we call the labels.

25
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,350
Or how things are labeled on the screen.

26
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,258
So again, getting back to
the notion that the buttons and

27
00:01:37,258 --> 00:01:40,010
links and
elements like that are read to the user.

28
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,870
You want to ensure that those
have clear and concise labels.

29
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,830
And they're very contextual.

30
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:52,300
I think a good example here is,
let's say you have a screen that has,

31
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,320
let's say, emails, or
search results on there.

32
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,480
And you have pagination controls,
like a next and previous button below.

33
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,120
Instead of having the screen reader just
read out next or previous, having a bit

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,710
more context, like next 50 emails,
or next 50 results, is really really

35
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,520
beneficial and a very small change
from the designer's point of view.

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,050
>> Right.
I mean,

37
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,430
I could imagine like maybe seeing a buy
button, but it's like well, buy what?

38
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,080
>> Right.
One thing that's really

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,880
important to understand is
the way screen readers work.

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,000
They go through the page very linearly.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,430
And so, by the time they
traverse through the site and

42
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,810
reach the buttons that are usually
at the bottom of the page,

43
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,160
they might have lost some
context of where they were.

44
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,860
>> Yeah.
So how can I work with a screen reader?

45
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,490
Like, where would I go to use that,
or use it with a product?

46
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,080
>> The great thing about screen readers
especially on mobile is that they

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,970
are already built in.

48
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,940
So if you have an Android or
Apple phone, you can easily go to

49
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,630
the settings and within there,
there are accessibilities settings.

50
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,841
And you can turn on Talk Back for
Android and in Apple, it's Voice Over.

51
00:02:54,841 --> 00:03:00,400
And what I tell everybody is, turn that
on and try to use your phone for a day.

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,070
And get that experience
doing your daily tasks,

53
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,830
but only using a screen reader and the
key there is to not look at your screen.

54
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,300
So closing your eyes or
dimming your screen for a day and

55
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,150
just see if you can achieve
your everyday tasks.

56
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,100
>> Wow.
That sounds pretty tough.

57
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,960
What sort of other concerns are there
for maybe mobile accessibility?

58
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,540
>> I think one of the unique things
about mobile is, it's a touch screen.

59
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,510
So one key thing to keep in mind
are the touch target sizes and

60
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,230
ensuring that they're large enough.

61
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,970
And this isn't just for
people with disabilities.

62
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,750
We all have different shaped hands and
levels of dexterity.

63
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,460
And so considering that, and
that ensuring that you don't need

64
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,210
a small pen tip to actually
focus in on a button or

65
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,860
something like that is extremely
important and valuable.

66
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,280
>> And what other considerations
are there for accessibility?

67
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,450
>> Well, there's definitely a lot more,
but I think one other

68
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,260
important one that we touched on
a little bit before is color contrast.

69
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,540
And I think,
it's It is a good one to focus on,

70
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,080
because you can focus on it early
just in the design and mock stage.

71
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,040
And it's an easy thing to consider.

72
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,590
And so there is a specific Color
Contrast Ratio that you need to meet

73
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,640
in order to achieve these standards.

74
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,839
The great thing about this is, there's
a ton of online Color Contrast Checkers

75
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,000
that you can simply plug in your
hex codes of your text color, and

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,410
your background color, and
see if you meet these, these standards.

77
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,940
So it's really easy, and again,
just something you can take care of and

78
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,040
think about really early
on in the design process.

79
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,540
>> Yeah.
