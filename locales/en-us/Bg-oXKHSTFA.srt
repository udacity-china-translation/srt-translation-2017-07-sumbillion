1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,350
So, what is the final advice you can
give an entrepreneur that starts

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,770
a design sprint?

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,560
>> The first key benefit of
a sprint is the opportunity for

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,540
everyone to participate
in the design and

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,980
decision making process
regardless of their background.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,960
A designer or researcher,

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,170
someone who is a user experience expert
will be able to come in as a leader, and

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,200
they'll be able to create great
prototypes or lead the user testing.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,450
An engineer, or a product manager, or
someone who doesn't have a lot of design

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,890
experience, will still
be able to participate.

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,590
Because they'll have tremendous
ideas as experts, and

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,638
they'll be able to contribute
by learning what the users want.

13
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:40,772
By allowing the whole team to be
involved in the design process, and

14
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:45,267
to make meaningful and fast decisions,
this sprint aligns the team, and

15
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:48,549
now they're a real community
that has a common goal.

16
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:53,400
The second benefit of a sprint is the
ability to redefine your talent pool.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,410
Often, large companies and

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,110
startups are lacking key resources
that they need for the sprint.

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,420
Because sprints are short,

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,560
they're an opportunity to invite someone
who's missing talent from your team.

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,000
If you don't have a researcher, you can
find and hire someone who's an esteemed

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,820
colleague or an expert in research, and
they can join you for two to five days.

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,030
That makes it so
your talent pool is much larger.

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,440
And third, the sprints have
the obvious advantage of speed, and

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,660
speed is the ultimate advantage.
