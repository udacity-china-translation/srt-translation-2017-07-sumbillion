00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,310
Now, I'd like you to use one
assistive technology and

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,230
complete a task with one of your
favorite mobile apps or websites.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,200
If you're using Mac,
you can open System Preferences and

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,560
then click on Accessibility.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,430
You might try to invert colors or
use grayscale or

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,286
you could play around with these other
options, such as Zoom and Voiceover.

7
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:23,288
As you use one of
the accessibility tools,

8
00:00:23,288 --> 00:00:25,628
I'd like you to answer
the following questions.

9
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:28,140
Can you find all of
the critical content?

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,440
Can you navigate the page or

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,110
the application and
find the links that you want?

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,500
And finally, can you actually
complete the chosen task?

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,940
This will help you get into
the mindset of your users and

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,910
develop empathy for them.

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,589
You'll get a quick sense about which
products are accessible and useable for

16
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:45,296
most users and which ones aren't.

17
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:48,200
Once you've done this task,
check this box to continue.
