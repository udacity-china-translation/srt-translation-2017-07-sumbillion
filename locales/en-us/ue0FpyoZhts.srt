00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,495
Welcome back! In this lesson,

2
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:04,676
we will prepare you for deploying ES6

3
00:00:04,676 --> 00:00:07,041
in the ever changing environment that is in the Web.

4
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,755
Basically, the web had a beginning,

5
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:11,190
but it won't have an end.

6
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:12,679
As new technology comes out,

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,053
it won't be supported by older browsers.

8
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:18,568
And this can make it challenging when you want to work with ES6.

9
00:00:18,568 --> 00:00:20,528
How are you supposed to write ES6,

10
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:22,459
but still support older browsers?

11
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,310
Well, let's take a look.
