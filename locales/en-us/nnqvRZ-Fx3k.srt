1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,430
When you start up a
terminal, what do you see?

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,759
Usually, you see a Shell prompt.

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,089
But what it says will differ
from system to system.

4
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:12,539
Like, the one that comes
with Git Bash for Windows

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,489
will look like this.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,920
But the one over on the
Mac will look like that.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,950
Here, this one shows the name
of the computer I'm using,

8
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:23,910
which is flexo, the current
working directory, which

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,089
is the home directory,
abbreviated tilde, and the name

10
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:29,940
of the user I'm logged
in as, which is student.

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,920
But there's a whole
bunch of information

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,920
that you can put in
the Shell prompt.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,980
This here is from the Bash
manual, which unfortunately

14
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:39,989
doesn't get installed
in Git Bash for Windows,

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,270
but you can look it up online.

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,090
In order to use any of
these or many other codes

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,950
that you can put in
there, you put them

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,679
in the PS1 Shell variable.

19
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,369
And where would you do that?

20
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:53,599
Well, in your .bash
profile, usually--

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,670
or .bashrc if you're on Linux,
or if you did that trick to get

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,600
it to run there as well.

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,439
So here's a .bash profile
containing a complicated PS1

24
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,528
prompt.

25
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,570
Let's see what that does.

26
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:10,709
Oh wow, now this prompt is
almost as colorful as the one

27
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,299
over on Windows.

28
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,090
And it has a little clock in
it, which is pretty handy.

29
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,980
So what do people put in PS1?

30
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,454
Well, a lot of developers
have a display information

31
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:21,869
about the current state of the
project they're working on.

32
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,750
You'll see more about
that in a later course.

33
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,209
Me, I usually keep
it pretty simple.

34
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:29,039
This complicated one,
I actually came up

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,380
with using a site called
bashrcgenerator.com.

36
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:34,939
Especially when I'm
building courses

37
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,829
and I don't want to distract
you with what directory I'm in,

38
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,030
sometimes I'll just set
PS1 to a single dollar

39
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,730
sign followed by a space.

40
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,100
I'm going to keep it simple.
