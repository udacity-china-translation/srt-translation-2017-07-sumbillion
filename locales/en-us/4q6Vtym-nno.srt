1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,220
OK so regardless of
what system you're on,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,030
you're going to want to open
up a terminal window now.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,660
On Windows, that's the Git
Bash you've been working with.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,560
On the Mac, you'll find
the terminal program

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,140
in the Utilities folder.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,850
On a Linux system,
the terminal program

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,600
is usually pretty easy to find,
but can be in different places.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,720
It doesn't matter which terminal
program you end up using,

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,820
the terminal is just an
interface to the Shell

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,445
and to other command
line programs that

11
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,760
will be running inside it.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,920
Kind of like how your web
browser is an interface

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,960
to websites and services.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,299
Now, pretty much
every terminal program

15
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:38,459
has a bunch of settings
that you can mess around

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,277
with to change the fonts,
and colors, and so on.

17
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:44,609
Now, we're not going to do a
lot of that in this course.

18
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,424
But do feel free to
adjust them to whatever

19
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:48,719
is comfortable for you.

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,149
Now something to
keep in mind, you

21
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,859
can have multiple
terminals open at once.

22
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:57,329
In fact, you can have any number
of terminals open at once.

23
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,879
Each one of them has its
own instance of the Shell--

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,830
a separate process
on your computer.

25
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,039
So if you happen to do
something in one terminal that

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,920
freezes or breaks it,
well, you can always

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,829
just use another one.

28
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:12,049
As you go through this
course, another thing

29
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,819
that will help you is to
look things up online.

30
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:16,849
There is a wealth of
information about the Unix

31
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:18,140
shell on the web.

32
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,359
If you're wondering
how to do something

33
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:23,310
or looking for a command that
you've never seen before,

34
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,600
use your favorite search engine.
