1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,980
In the last lesson, you learned how to
plan and execute a design sprint so

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,860
you can test prototypes with real users.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,050
>> In this lesson you'll
learn about metrics and

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,830
how can you tie them to
improve your products?

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,680
You'll use these metrics to
drive business decisions and

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,670
prioritize what you want to work on,
on the next design sprint.

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,550
>> To get started, let's look at a
couple different metrics that you might

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,420
be interested in measuring.
