1
00:00:01,381 --> 00:00:03,129
Actually, a little
programming language.

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:06,660
And just like JavaScript or
Python, it has variables.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,699
They look a little
different, though.

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,419
In the Shell, whenever you
create or modify a variable,

5
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,800
you just give its
name and an equal sign

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,230
followed by the value
that you want it to have.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,050
Note, that you can't put any
spaces around the equal sign.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,600
Then when you want to
refer to the variable,

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,320
you put a dollar sign
in front of its name.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,100
There are actually
two different kinds

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,900
of variables in the Shell.

12
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:33,739
One of them is called
a Shell variable.

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,469
The lines and columns
variables that you saw earlier

14
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:37,719
are this kind.

15
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,299
These are just internal to
the Shell program itself.

16
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:44,829
The other kind is called
an environment variable.

17
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:47,259
Environment variables
are shared with programs

18
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:48,969
that you run from
within the Shell.

19
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:51,670
One environment variable
that's really important

20
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,020
is the Path variable.

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,480
That tells your system where
your Program Files are.

22
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,329
So when you type a
command such as ls,

23
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:01,519
it can find the
program to run it.

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,680
For instance, on my system
the ls program is in /bin.ls.

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,810
So it's in the /bin directory.

26
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,530
And the /bin directory is
here in my path variable.

27
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,299
The directories in
the path variable

28
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:16,280
are separated by colons.

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,430
And the Shell searches them
starting with the first one,

30
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,890
and then proceeding to
the right until it finds

31
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,950
the command that you entered.

32
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,450
And that's how the Shell is
able to find the ls command when

33
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,656
I want to run it.

34
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:29,030
You'll sometimes
see instructions

35
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,489
telling you to add a
directory to your path

36
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:33,739
so that programs
in it can be found.

37
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:35,809
To add the new directory
to the end of your path,

38
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,430
you do it like this--

39
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:43,150
PATH=$PATH: and then
the new directory.

40
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,120
But if you do it like this
right at the Shell prompt,

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,039
that change will only last
until you close the Shell.

42
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,829
We'll take a look at
where you do it if you

43
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:52,780
want to keep that change.

44
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,590
But first, a couple of quizzes.
