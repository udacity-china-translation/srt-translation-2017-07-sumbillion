1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,210
As I mentioned,

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:05,420
you will need to define the design
challenge before the design sprint.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,470
To help you decide on
the design challenge,

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,250
here's some things that you can do.

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,260
First, you should
interview key stakeholders.

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,710
Stakeholders can be investors,
designers, or engineers.

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,030
They can also be someone like the user,
or anyone else related to the product.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,730
Second, you should identify or review
any of the use cases for the product.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,190
Next, you should review all
relevant user research.

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:28,850
And finally,

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,830
you should review any current designs
that you have on the product.

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,900
If you're planning your
first design sprint,

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,850
it's likely that you will not
have any current designs.

14
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,720
In that case, you should focus
on these first three tasks

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,730
when going about the design sprint.

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,340
At Udacity,
we recently planned two design sprints.

17
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,490
The first design challenge involved
redesigning the entire user journey

18
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,170
through a nanodegree from the time the
user hears about a nanodegree, the time

19
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,370
that that user graduates and advances
their career or lands a new job.

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,730
A second design sprint focused on one
particular part of our user journey.

21
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,730
We started to think about how to
redesign student support through forms,

22
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,980
code reviews, and other methods.

23
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,410
You'll need to plan a specific
design challenge like these for

24
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,820
your own product, and
it's likely that it will be for

25
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,680
the main user journey, navigation,
and key tasks that users will perform.

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,320
The design challenge statement is
what you need to actually write, and

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,460
it creates a single focus for
what is the output of the design sprint.

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,660
A good challenge statement should
have a couple key qualities.

29
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,230
First, it should be relevant to the
highest priority work of the team, and

30
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,120
it should be tied to a purpose or
key result.

31
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,750
It should also be concise and to
the point, and hopefully inspiring for

32
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,090
yourself.

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,800
The design challenge statement should
also include a target audience, or

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,179
segments of that audience.

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,010
And finally, for
projects that are in progress,

36
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,330
you'll want to include a launch time
stated in terms of years or quarters.

37
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,390
So, would you want to be
launching in Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4?

38
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,310
Your design challenge statement
will identify the tangible

39
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,250
items that you want to have at
the end of the design sprint.

40
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,720
And at the least,
it should answer one of two questions.

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,720
What are you missing
that you need critically?

42
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,140
Or, what is the riskiest decision or

43
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,270
hypothesis that you want
to test with your users?

44
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,730
You can use a gap analysis like this one
to determine what the product is missing

45
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,850
or what's one of the riskier decisions
or hypotheses that you need to test.

46
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,300
This checklist is linked
in the instructor notes.

47
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,150
Here's one example of
a challenge statement.

48
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,900
You might design a mobile app
that helps a visitor plan and

49
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,150
find the most relevant personalized and
exciting activities to do in a city,

50
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,655
keeping in mind that the visitor
only has one day for their visit.

51
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:48,965
The deliverables in this case would
be to get wireframe sketches for

52
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:52,302
ideas that would be
implemented in Q3 of 2015.

53
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:56,383
Your design challenge statement should
be similar, and have components

54
00:02:56,383 --> 00:03:00,589
like the what of the deliverable, the
time frame for when you need it by, and

55
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:05,990
also a clear user with what they'll be
doing in the application or the product.

56
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,180
Now, the goal for your first sprint
will likely to be to map out

57
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,470
the basics of your new website or
app, including some flows, pages, or

58
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,960
screens, and the basic navigation.

59
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,200
Now that you know about a challenge
statement I'd like you to think about

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,490
one for your own design sprint.

61
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,580
What would you create and
for what kind of users, and

62
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,610
by when would you create it and
in order to do what?

63
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,870
Take a minute to think about this and
then write your answer in the box below.

64
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,420
Don't feel like you need to commit to
this one design sprint challenge for

65
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,400
your own design sprint.

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,760
You could actually change this
later in your final project.
