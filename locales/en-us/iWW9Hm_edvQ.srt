1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,740
Because you can either win or

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,240
learn in a Design Sprint,
your next steps are going to vary.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,430
Now, it's likely that you' receive
feedback from users about how they used

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,740
the product, and what they didn't like.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,570
In this case, you'll need to reconsider
some user flows or you might need to

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,190
make some small adjustments in the user
interface, such as clarifying user

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,640
actions or making particular buttons and
links more prominent.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,310
If you received critical feedback
about the value proposition or

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,770
if users are not clear in what
they can do with the product,

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,320
then you should revisit
the original idea.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,840
You might alter the original idea or

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,930
validate that the product
solves the user's problem.

13
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,550
Entrepreneurs see these moments
as learning opportunities.

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,470
So don't feel like this type
of moment is a setback.

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,840
If you receive mostly positive feedback,
then you need to monitor metrics and

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,810
continue to improve your product.

17
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,895
As you get more feedback on the product,
you can add more features and

18
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:50,730
fine-tune the user experience.

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,676
You'll see examples of this and
learn about metrics in the next lesson.
