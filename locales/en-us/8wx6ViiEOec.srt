1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,540
So for me,

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:06,510
as an entrepreneur, what are the type of
design types that I need to care about?

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,650
>> So
my specialty is interaction design,

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,060
so as you've probably guessed from
me saying task, task, task over and

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,510
over again for the last few minutes,
that's where I bias towards.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,870
So kind of we focus on trying to
understand users and behaviors.

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,020
Think about the types of things
that they want to do, and

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,580
how to best fulfill them.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,410
Now that's just one of
the specializations.

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,780
There's many.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,810
Other very common ones
are visual design.

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,430
They focus on everything

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,880
that the user sees while they're
engaging with your experience.

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,450
>> Is there like, colors,
and stuff like that, or?

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,530
>> Colors is one, but it's also
things like layout, like scale,

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,840
any iconography that's there,
everything from fonts and

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,050
upward, anything that becomes
a pixel in that piece of software.

18
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,250
>> Right.
>> Visual design

19
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,960
tries to concentrate on that.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,900
And there's thousands of small
decisions that go into that,

21
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,310
that is their specialization.

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,350
Then there's also things
like motion design.

23
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,600
This is a newer focus for
design in many cases.

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,240
And they're concerned with how
anything animates, big or small.

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,380
To give the user a sense that
their feedback is being heard, and

26
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,180
that the system's responding to it.

27
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,215
And just to kind of bring
the to life a little bit.

28
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:23,705
They make it feel like it's something
they're really kind of engaging in.

29
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:25,215
This push and pull way.

30
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:28,215
>> You can also stress things
with animation, right?

31
00:01:28,215 --> 00:01:29,105
>> Absolutely.

32
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:32,275
Animation is a great way to
tell the user where their

33
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:35,435
attention should be
focused at any given time.

34
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:37,225
And then there's other specializations.

35
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:42,240
There's things like Industrial design,
the design of physical objects.

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,440
>> Right.
>> There's sound design, there's conran,

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,180
or print design, and so
on and so on and so on.

38
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,860
Anything that you're doing
on this product that has

39
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,740
some decision that needs to be made,
there's probably

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,030
a whole discipline of design that
can help you make that decision.

41
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,220
>> So what you're basically telling me
is that I need to hire eight people?

42
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,830
>> Yes.

43
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,040
Wait, no, no.

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,960
You can get by with fewer.

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,520
>> Okay.
>> So I know most small teams just don't

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,730
have that capacity to hire
out all the specializations.

47
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,900
So the good news is that, in my
experience, most designers are hybrids.

48
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,220
They might identify as being one of
those specializations, but they often

49
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,560
have familiarity to varying degrees
with the other fields of the discipline.

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,370
So what's important to
keep in mind when you hire

51
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,810
is kind of have a sense of what
your expectations are going to be.

52
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,660
What are you going to need
out of this designer?

53
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,020
Do you need interaction and visual?

54
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,000
Do they need to work on your brand for
you?

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,376
And make sure that the capabilities
are in the people that you hire.

56
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:50,976
Or, make sure that they are comfortable
directing the work of contractors who

57
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:54,819
might be able to kind of augment
the capabilities that they lack.

58
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,510
>> How do they know if they're any good?

59
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,930
>> [LAUGH] Wow, that's a good question.

60
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,250
I think the best way to judge
a designer is from their work.

61
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,990
So you should certainly ask for
work samples.

62
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,630
You should look for the portfolio.

63
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,370
You should find out what kind of
things get them excited about design.

64
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,680
>> Right.

65
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,060
>> Are they very focused on the user and
on simplicity?

66
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,800
Are they a designer who can come in and
give more pizzazz, a little sex appeal,

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,970
a little gloss to the product?

68
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,640
There's appeal to having all those
types of people involved with the work.
