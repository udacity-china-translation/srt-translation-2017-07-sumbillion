1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,540
So I can start with idea validation and

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,870
go all the way to see if
my product works well.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,420
>> Absolutely,

4
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,730
there's ways for user research to
help you throughout that process.

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,330
>> Okay, so we talked about user
research, but what does a designer do?

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,420
>> Well, if you're
an interaction designer like me,

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,480
you're going to spend a lot
of time grappling with tasks.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,070
You're going to think about,
well what are all of the different tasks

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,390
that the user is going to
perform inside of this product?

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,100
And, for every given task that you have,
you're going to try to dive in and

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,200
just try to figure out that sequence
of interactions that the user is going

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,330
to have.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,510
And sometimes you can think
about that like a dialogue.

14
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,290
Think about, well if the user does x,
the system's going to do y, and

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,750
then the user is going to come back and
do z.

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,490
You'll kind of go through that, and
you'll start by just kind of shaping one

17
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,580
of those, but then you'll kind
of go broader and broader.

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,310
You'll think about all the other
variants of that same task, so

19
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,810
what if the user does w instead of y?

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,000
And how does the system respond to that?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,980
And that'll help you just kind of
understand what some of the constraints

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,620
are and what some of the things you
need to account for in the design.

23
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:08,700
And then from there you go
kind of bigger and bigger.

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,150
You think about what
the next task is and

25
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,470
you start to kind of chain those
together in interesting ways.

26
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,890
You'll start to see things that
are kind of commonalities.

27
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,910
Tasks that are similar or
sometimes even the same to each other,

28
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,960
that are kind of good opportunities.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,997
And also things that are really unique,
particular tasks that have these very,

30
00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:35,543
one-off set of interactions
that don't occur elsewhere.

31
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:39,390
>> So I have to map every interaction?

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,880
>> Well either you're
going to map them all or

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,330
the user's going to kind of
have to create their own map.

34
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,630
So trying to anticipate as many
of those interactions as you

35
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,390
can is going to make it easier for

36
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,440
the user to kind of follow through
on those goals inside your product.
