1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,640
I'm back with Yunha
again from Locket and

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,530
we're going to be discussing design
principles and the user experience.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,630
And specifically for Locket, what did
you know you needed to get right for

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,540
the user experience?

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,130
>> I think because it's the lock screen,
which is what you're so used to,

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,755
your default experience, so we're
basically changing that experience.

7
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:22,300
>> Mm-hm.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,250
>> And
saying that this is a new lock screen.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,690
This is a real estate swiping
over 150 times per day.

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,677
We need to make it very user-friendly.

11
00:00:30,677 --> 00:00:33,830
And the goal of the lock screen is so
that you can unlock it so

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,050
that you can go to your home screen.

13
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,300
So we can't make it too
long of a process, either.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,680
We want to make it simple.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,490
Also, you don't know who you're going
to be with when you check your phone,

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,200
so the lock screen needs to be okay for
your kids to see.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,180
Or for
you to be able to just wake up to it.

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,370
So it needs to be delightful as well.

19
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,580
So when we were building the content
on the lock screen which is currently

20
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:03,060
locked, if we were just using
the RSS feeds out there.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,411
>> And just like slapping those
images on the lock screen,

22
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:08,510
it might not be delightful.

23
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,110
You might see a lot of blood or

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,792
there might be gun involved
on the lock screen.

25
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:16,519
So we had to start from a manual
place where we want to make sure

26
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:21,051
each lock screen that we're delivering,
to our user, is delightful and

27
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:24,870
something that you want to wake up to,
that you can see.

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,870
But at the same time, we also need to
deliver these real content, which is,

29
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,530
like, hey there's
an earthquake coming up, so

30
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,920
you can't be like a smily face, right.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,970
So how do you walk that fine line.

32
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,480
Also on the lock screen
interaction side,

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,530
because you're unlocking your phone.

34
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,600
And you have some users that
are unlocking with the left hand

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,720
versus right hand.

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,970
You got to make sure that the button
here on the lock screen is something

37
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,110
that you can touch
from different angles.

38
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,820
>> Yeah.
>> I should be able to touch it.

39
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,790
And if this is like two below,
it's hard to do that with the one hand.

40
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,810
You have to hold it with both hands.

41
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,320
And also, android phones,
their fragmentation is crazy.

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,340
You have like your Nexus to the big
tablet, you have the small phones.

43
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,101
How do you make them all look okay,
on all of those devices?

44
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:12,635
>> Right.

45
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:15,510
>> So a lot of those
considerations are involved.

46
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,290
And also like the weather.

47
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,780
How do you make the weather
shown while in the clock?

48
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,790
People also want to customize their lock
screen, so I customize it using Locket.

49
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,860
>> Okay.
>> Where you can just upload

50
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,425
your own photo.

51
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:28,200
>> Mm-hm.

52
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,900
And, are there any other
sort of design principles?

53
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,510
We talked a little bit about
sort of knowing your customer,

54
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,695
when they're using the product.

55
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:35,460
>> Mm-hm.
>> Knowing that

56
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,390
maybe they might be around other people,

57
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,030
what sort of other design principles
went into building Locket?

58
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,492
Maybe in terms of like an aesthetic
viewpoint or something like that.

59
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:46,930
>> Mm-hm.

60
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,520
So when we were,

61
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,480
yeah a few things that we were thinking
about is like making it delightful.

62
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,060
Like is this something that you
want to see on your locked screen

63
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,740
every single time?

64
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,820
Also, is this something that you feel
comfortable sharing with your niece or

65
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,880
a kid that you have.

66
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,410
We have a few guidelines as in like,

67
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,360
we have our own Locket brand guidelines
where you're not allowed to use red on

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,220
the lock screen or blood,
something like that.

69
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,611
>> Yeah.

70
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:20,194
>> I can't really think of one well, but

71
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:23,440
we were always focusing
on delightfulness.

72
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,930
>> Yeah.
>> On the lock screen.

73
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,430
>> Great.
