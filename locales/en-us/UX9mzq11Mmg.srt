00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,040
You've seen how
many Shell commands

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,160
can be given the name of
a file or a directory,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,259
like ls and cd can.

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,050
But that's not the only thing
you can tell a Shell command.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,570
Many of them also support
options, or flags,

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,600
or parameters that turn on extra
behavior or special features.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,359
Here's an example, ls-l--

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,339
the -l is an option to ls.

9
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,100
You can also use it along
with the name of a directory,

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,720
like this.

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,259
And what it does is to print out
a longer more detailed listing

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,820
of files.

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,439
The l is for long.

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,079
Try it out yourself and see
what you can find in it.

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,210
Here's something else you
can try along with it.

16
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,270
The Shell lets you match
filenames with a pattern.

17
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,600
Let's say you want to
list all the PDF documents

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,789
in your Documents directory.

19
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:53,240
The way to do this is
with a star, like this--

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,859
ls-l Documents/*.pdf.

21
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,920
The Shell turns the
star into a list

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,090
of all of the files whose
names match that pattern.

23
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,409
In this case, that's all of
the files whose file names end

24
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:10,992
in .pdf.
