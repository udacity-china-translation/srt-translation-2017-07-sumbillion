1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,509
So one of the cool
things about the shell

2
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:04,279
is there's always more to learn.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,780
I've been using it
for 20 plus years

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,403
and there are still
features I've never

5
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:09,800
gotten around to using, and
people keep writing new ones,

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,669
too.

7
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:12,410
As you grow as a
developer, you'll

8
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,939
probably build up
a shell profile

9
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:15,799
that works well for
you, just as you

10
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,940
customized other development
tools such as your text editor.

11
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,690
Now there are a heck
of a lot of resources

12
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,330
on the web full of tips
and tricks about the shell.

13
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:25,489
Secret incantations
and general magic

14
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:28,159
for configuring and accelerating
your shell environment.

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,079
I've put just a few
of them on this page.

16
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,399
Now have fun with it,
and keep learning.
