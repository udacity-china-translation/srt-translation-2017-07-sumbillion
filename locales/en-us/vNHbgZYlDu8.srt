Hi, I'm here with Pete Koomen,
who's a cofounder of Optimizely.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,450
Pete, could you tell me a little
bit about what Optimizely does?

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,040
>> Yeah, we make it easy for
our customers to optimize and

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,470
personalize the experience they give
their customers on their web site or

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,710
mobile applications.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,530
>> Fantastic, and

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,200
what's one of your favorite memories
from early on at Optimizely?

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,600
>> There are a lot.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,590
I think probably the one I'm
most proud of is when we helped

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,900
the Clinton Bush Haiti campaign
raise a lot of money for

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,782
earthquake victims in 2010.

12
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:36,220
So Dan, my co-founder, and I were coming
off the back of two startup failures,

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,760
and we had just started
working on Optimizely, and

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,030
we were building an easier way to
run A/B tests on your website.

15
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,375
And a few weeks into the project,
we got a call from somebody on a newly

16
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:53,150
set-up organization, the Clinton Bush
Haiti Fund that was created to try and

17
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,150
raise money for the victims of
this horrible earthquake in Haiti.

18
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,580
And they had one beleaguered IT guy
I think who built this website and

19
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,580
was struggling to keep it up.

20
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,380
And they were getting hundreds of
thousands of visitors every day.

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,710
And they called us because they had
worked with Dan on the Obama campaign

22
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,350
in 2008 and
they wanted to improve the website.

23
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,740
They wanted to earn more money for these
earthquake victims from the website.

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,790
And so over the course of several days,

25
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,230
we barely slept at all, we built
the beginnings of our platform and

26
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,230
then we ran a bunch of A/B
tests on their website.

27
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,620
What I mean by that is that we
took a look at their website, and

28
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,618
came up with hypotheses of how
could we make this better.

29
00:01:32,618 --> 00:01:36,480
And maybe it's adding an image of
earthquake victims next to the credit

30
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,300
card form, or changing the layout,
or making the text more readable.

31
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,220
And after a whole bunch of these
experiments, we were able to measure

32
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,130
that this particular change actually
improved the conversion rate.

33
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,100
This one harmed it.

34
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,350
This one improved it.

35
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,570
And we were able to actually
raise their dollars per eyeball,

36
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,680
essentially, by 10%.

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,510
And so we actually helped them
raise an extra million dollars for

38
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,690
the victims of the earthquake.

39
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,310
>> That's incredible.
