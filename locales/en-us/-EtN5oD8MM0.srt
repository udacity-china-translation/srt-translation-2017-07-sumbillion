00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,209
Hey, there.

2
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:03,149
Let's talk about
the shell The shell

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,370
is a command-line interface
for running programs

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,509
on your computer.

5
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,070
You type commands at a prompt.

6
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,460
And the shell runs programs for
you and shows you their output.

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,610
Developers use it a lot,
because it's fast and flexible.

8
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:17,369
Also, the vast majority
of web servers in the wild

9
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,450
run on Linux.

10
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,640
And the shell is a vital
tool for deployment

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,449
and remote administration
on Linux servers.

12
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:26,609
Now, compared to using a
graphical environment, or GUI,

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,439
when you use the
shell, you do have

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,230
to remember a bunch of magic
words and incantations.

15
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,660
But in exchange, once
you get some practice in,

16
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,219
you get to do things
really quickly

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,049
without a lot of
pointing and clicking.

18
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:39,539
It's kind of like
programming, really.

19
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,000
If you've used the JavaScript
console in your browser,

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,880
or any other programming
languages interpreter, well,

21
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,000
the idea of the shell's command
line is pretty much the same.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,460
You type out instructions
in a special language,

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,630
and the system runs them.

24
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,504
And it shows you the
output underneath.

25
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:54,669
Then you get another prompt.

26
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,130
And you can do it again.

27
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,950
The JavaScript console is a
command line for your browser.

28
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,870
But the shell is a command line
for your computer in general,

29
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,509
working with files
and directories,

30
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:05,129
running programs,
and interacting

31
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,750
with other computers.

32
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,540
Now, the program that we use
to interact with the shell

33
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,400
is called a terminal program.

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,320
If you're on Mac or
Linux, you've already

35
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,519
got a good one of these.

36
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,631
It's got an icon
that looks like this.

37
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:18,090
If you're on Windows,
though, we'll

38
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,340
take a look at how to
install a shell and terminal

39
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,590
program that works the same
as the ones on Mac and Linux.

40
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,740
Windows does have a
built-in command shell.

41
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:28,439
It's based on the old MS-DOS
command line rather than

42
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,879
the UNIX heritage.

43
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,859
For web developers,
a UNIX-style shell

44
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,019
is pretty much a
professional standard,

45
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:36,629
because so much of the
web runs on Linux servers.

46
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,789
So that's what we'll be
looking at in this course.

47
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,280
Specifically, will be
using the Bash shell,

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,436
which is by far the most
popular UNIX-style shell.

49
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:46,769
The first thing we'll do in
this course is to get you up

50
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:47,985
and running in the terminal.

51
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:49,859
Then we'll take a quick
tour of show commands

52
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,019
for navigating files
and directories.

53
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:54,599
You'll learn commands for
downloading files from the web,

54
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,209
viewing text files, and
customizing the shell itself

55
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:58,409
to make it friendlier.

56
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,709
So let's get started.
