00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,040
To wrap up this lesson, I really want
you to think about what you've learned

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,970
and what you might do next.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,530
Metrics from user behavior and
feedback from users are critical

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,270
if you want to improve the product and
forge ahead.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,050
As you reflect on data, you may want
to plan additional design sprints.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,390
We actually did this at Udacity
to rethink student support.

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,850
A design sprint can be a great way
to make changes to the product.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,580
You might also discover that
you've chosen a poor metric, or

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,390
that you're not retaining users.

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,260
If so, then you might want to
rethink your key metrics or

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,159
alter the original idea.

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,080
Ultimately, it's up to you to iterate on
a product, or reimagine a product, so

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,440
that way,
you build something users love.
