1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,870
There are six stages or
modes of a design sprint.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,810
And each of these stages solves
an important part of the design process.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,890
The first phase is the understand phase.

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,000
In this phase, you're trying to
get clarity on the business goals,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,640
the problem you're solving for,
technical feasibility, the market, and

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,120
user needs.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,940
You've actually already been working on
some of this throughout the first two

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,430
lessons of the course.

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,260
And there are other activities that
you can do, which I'll cover later.

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,130
The second stage is the define stage.

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,700
In this stage, you might define the goal
for the product or certain features.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,120
This might include the positioning,
a user journey, or

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,460
metrics related to the product or
those certain features.

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,050
We'll cover more about
metrics in lesson 4.

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,900
Now, this stage is similar to what
Richard Fulcher was talking about when

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,230
he mentioned tasks that
are related to a user's goals.

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,430
For example, a user may search for
a particular grocery item

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,090
in our shopping app, which would be
then added to the cart for purchase.

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,080
The third stage is the diverge stage.

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,320
In this stage, you want to create
as many solutions as you can

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,560
to the original design challenge.

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,090
And this is the stage where you really
get to unleash your creativity.

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,670
It's the fun part.

24
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,190
The fourth stage is the decide stage,
and in this stage,

25
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,210
you really just want to deliberate
about the ideas that you came up with

26
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,895
in the previous diverge stage, refine
those, and then choose the best one or

27
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:28,605
some combination of the ideas so that
way you get a best possible product.

28
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:32,735
The fifth stage is
the prototyping stage.

29
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:36,145
In this stage, you want to actually
create and build the wireframes,

30
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:40,625
the mockups, or the prototypes that
you'll actually test with real users.

31
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,685
These are the deliverables
of the design sprint.

32
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:47,410
And finally,
the last stage is the validation stage.

33
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,770
In this stage, you really want to
test your products with real users.

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,080
You're testing your wireframes,
your mockups, or your prototypes, to

35
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,050
determine whether or not the hypotheses,
or your risky assumptions are true.

36
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,890
You're trying to figure out whether or
not you have the right product, and

37
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,790
whether or not it's usable.

38
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,690
So there you have it,
the six stages of a design sprint.

39
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:15,190
Understand, define, diverge,
decide, prototype, and validate.

40
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,480
Throughout this lesson, Amir will
interview a design sprint master

41
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,200
at Google and
talk more about each of these stages.

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,300
I'll follow those videos by
describing activities that you can do

43
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,660
with each of these stages.

44
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,590
As you watch the videos, think about
which activities might be helpful for

45
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,100
your specific design challenge.
