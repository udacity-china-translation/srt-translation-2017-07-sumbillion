00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,710
You've done some idea validation, and

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,110
now you know about designing
an awesome user experience.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,550
We're going to show you how to use
design sprints to put the product in

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,030
front of your users.

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,940
>> The founder of LinkedIn,
Reid Hoffman, once said, if you're not

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,390
embarrassed by the first version of
your product, you launched too late.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,860
We want you to take the same advice
when it comes to putting a product

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,860
in front of your users.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,040
It can be nerve-wracking to test your
product, but it's also super important

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,680
to learn quickly and
keep iterating on your product.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,970
Let's get started by hearing how
other start-ups have done this.
