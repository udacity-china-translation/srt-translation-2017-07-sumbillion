00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,910
Now that you've seen
a bunch of activities for

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:05,950
the define stage, I want you to practice
breaking down an overall product

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,400
experience into much simpler steps.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,170
Your task is to create a golden path for

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,210
users to successfully
use the shopping app.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,080
Now, keep in mind the golden path
should only have the main or

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,440
the essential steps that a user takes to
find the real value that they came for

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,340
the product in the first place.

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,640
Supporting threads,
such as editing orders or

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,060
creating accounts,
are secondary to the golden path.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,010
You can include those, but
they're not really essential for

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,950
the main tasks that the user
would need to perform.

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,550
And remember that you should be thinking
in terms of stories rather than pages.

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,500
This helps you prioritize the central or
the key user journey.

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,290
So go ahead and create a Golden Path for
the Super Duper Shopping App.

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,650
Keep in mind the previous personas,
the first tweet, and

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,450
the one page executive summary.

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,420
You can see the Instructor Notes for
these materials.

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,900
Once you're ready,
