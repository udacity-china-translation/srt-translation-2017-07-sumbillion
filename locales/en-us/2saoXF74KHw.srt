00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,060
I'm back here with Pete Koomen again.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,540
And Pete, I let you talk a little bit
about the user experience and what is

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,230
was so important for Optimizely to get
right about your user's experience

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,590
>> Sure.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,750
So when we started Optimizely,

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,130
we set out to make an A/B testing
platform that anybody could use.

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,660
And, in fact, our slogan was A/B
testing you'll actually use.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,792
And we weren't the first people
to build an A/B testing platform.

9
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:29,483
People have been A/B testing, frankly,

10
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:34,950
since the days of mail catalogs,
back in the early 1900s.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,200
The approach that we took to it was that
products are out there that let you do

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,964
this, but they were really hard to use.

13
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:44,828
And for that reason most people just
weren't doing this kind of optimization,

14
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:46,290
and this insight came.

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,500
My co-founder spent nine months or

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,898
ten months working on
the Obama campaign in 2008.

17
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:54,168
And he was the Director
of Analytics there, and

18
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:57,000
he ran a bunch of A/B tests for
the campaign.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,920
And those tests resulted in
a lot of additional money and

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,950
a lot of additional volunteers
being captured by the campaign.

21
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,650
And the insight coming out of it was,
hey,

22
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,700
this is really valuable, but boy that
was tough, that was a pain in the ass.

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,140
And so that was kind of
the insight that we started with.

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,840
And we just thought, there's
probably an easier way to do this.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,751
And so our approach from the outset
was this is a problem that's,

26
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:21,800
or sorry, this is something
that's already out there.

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,920
It's our job to make it much,
much easier, and so

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,780
we had to focus on the user.

29
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,048
And we built a way to create and
run an A/B test in a very visual way.

30
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:34,714
We tried to design it in
such a way that a marketer,

31
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:37,772
who didn't have an engineering
background, could do.

32
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:39,449
Yeah.
>> So you would definitely say it was

33
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:42,762
more of like a painkiller idea to
solve someone's pain point around

34
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:45,275
using A/B testing platforms
than anything else.

35
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:46,191
>> Absolutely.

36
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:50,691
So, and in fact what we discovered was
that the pain that was there was so

37
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:54,817
significant that most people
just weren't using this product.

38
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:57,761
And so at the outset, our biggest
competitor was not some other company

39
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:00,865
trying to sell a product, our biggest
competitor was non-consumption.

40
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:01,635
>> Yeah.
>> And

41
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:05,465
these companies just they'd heard about
A/B testing and some of them had tried

42
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:07,355
it, they just never were able
to get it to work for them.

43
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:09,195
And that's what we tried to solve.
