1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Promises are an incredibly powerful addition to the language,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,980
and a ton of both existing and future changes make use of them.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,375
So being able to work with and write JavaScript promises is vital.

4
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:12,060
They're so important, we've actually created

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,470
a standalone course dedicated to just JavaScript Promises.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,910
Hang on a second. Hey Cameron.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,498
Hey Richard. It's good to see you.

8
00:00:19,498 --> 00:00:22,439
We were talking about JavaScript Promises and we told

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,267
them about our dedicated course on JavaScript Promises,

10
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:28,184
and we thought, did you want to talk about that a little bit?

11
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:32,295
I made a course on Promises – they're awesome – and you should go take it.

12
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:36,465
And the reason is is that Promises make it so much easier to do asynchronous code.

13
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:39,840
With Promises, your code's going to be easier to read, easier to write,

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,370
and most importantly as you all know,

15
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:43,609
it's gonna be a lot easier to debug.

16
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:44,789
And while you're working on this class,

17
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,259
you'll be also building an app called the Exoplanet Explore.

18
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:50,579
This is a really cool app because it helps people learn about

19
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,994
planets around other stars in our galaxy, real planets.

20
00:00:53,994 --> 00:00:56,309
So it's really amazing and it's really fun and you

21
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,963
should definitely check out the course if you want to master Promises.

22
00:00:58,963 --> 00:01:01,000
You'll find a link to the course below.
