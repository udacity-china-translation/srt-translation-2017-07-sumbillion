00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,484
So we just looked at Sets and WeakSets,

2
00:00:02,484 --> 00:00:05,459
but I want to turn your attention towards Maps and WeakMaps.

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,990
Maps and WeakMaps, share a lot of things in common with Sets and WeakSets.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,405
They both have similar properties and methods.

5
00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:15,734
Maps and Sets are both iterable which means you can loop over them.

6
00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:20,149
And WeakMaps and WeakSets don't prevent objects from being garbage collected.

7
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:24,029
However, Maps are unique because they're collections of key-value pairs,

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,000
whereas Sets are collections of unique values.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,550
You could say that Sets are to arrays,

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,670
as Maps are to objects.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,620
Yeah, that's good. In this next section,

12
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,129
we'll look at how you can create and use Maps and WeakMaps.
